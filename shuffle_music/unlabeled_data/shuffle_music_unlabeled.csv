Discovered Bill Evans via his son, Evan Evans and recently downloaded it. I hope to discover more of his work soon."
24,b,"A very basic yet effective pop melody. In my 20s, I would go out to see 1927 on a regular basis and fell in love with their music. They are reformed pop/rock band from the late 1980s.

No.  Not this track in Particular but the group in general,"
29,a,"It reminds me of the last time I listened to this band, about 2-3 years ago Because I love this band It's very relaxing music, and it's partly instrumental / partly in a language I don't understand (Czech) which makes it great for listening to when reading or thinking Yes, it reminds me of my life 2-3 years ago - which was completely different to it is now - which is when I last listened to it."

It reminds me of when I saw this band live a couple months ago - they played it at the concert Because I have almost every other song by this band, but I didn't have this one yet, so I saved it I love this track because it's upbeat and I still haven't learned the words yet (it's in Swedish), which is a challenge because I'm still a beginner at Swedish Yes, I saw this band live a couple months ago and they played this song at the concert, and it was the first time I had ever heard it.

I listened to this song while high on LSD and because of it this song is very special to me. 
31,b,"Triumph I love Fleetwood Mac, and this song is iconic Fleetwood Mac. It's so catchy, and it makes me think I can do anything. I know all the words and can sing along. Stevie Nick's voice is awesome and she has to sing it with her ex which makes it even better. Also it's just an awesome song. Yes, I think I have a relationship with every one of Fleetwood Mac's song, but I think this one is especially important. It makes me think I can make it through changes, and that no matter what happens, things will be okay."
32,a,"Great track...  One of my favourite bands, their latest album Not too loud just a nice, chilled song Not especially."
32,b,"Reminds me of the concert I attended last year Not too noisy, nice chilled song Brings back nice memories of the gig, a chilled but enjoyable song Yes, reminds me of a great concert and randomly bumping into an old friend that I hadn't seen in years"
33,a,"University days, singing this at the top of our lungs at the end of a night out.  I love it The memories associated with it yes Yes it reminds me of university days. "
33,b,Dancing I love it It motivates me especially when exercising.  I love to listen to it when in the gym
34,a,The video game Guitar hero (as thats where i first heard the song) Its catchy to walk/travel to and is fairly neutral (doesnt really have any emotional connotations) Catchy/easy to time with walking pace No not really
35,a,PUMP UP THE BASS!!!  It's my favorite song at the moment I enjoy listening to this song very much. Whenever I hear the song its like a wake up call and I'm filled with energy Im not completely sure what you mean by relationship
36,a,"I saw them at SnowGlobe. I like the Chainsmokers.  I heard them live and started listening to their music, and it reminds me of how much fun that music festival was.  No, it doesn't particularly speak to me. "
36,b,It reminds me of high school in a good way.  Because I fuck with G-Eazy heavy It gets me hyped up and reminds me of all the adventures I had in high school with my friends.  Yes. I've listened to him since before he was big and he's from the same place I'm from. I saw him go from nothing to something and he raps about that in this song. 
37,a,"Love the meld of music and voice.  Enjoy the band and wanted to hear more of their stuff I love the sound, and find the lyrics intriguing.  No, but I suspect I will. "
37,b,"Dreary and dirge like.  I wanted to explore more of Whitaker's music I found it tedious. It couldn't quite make up its mind what it wanted to be. The mood kept shifting.  No, this is the first time I've heard it. "
38,a,"My boyfriend I have all of Beyonce's music saved but this is one of my favourites. I think the lyrics are really meaningful and poetic. It has Prince vibes, who is another artist I love. Yes. It was playing when my boyfriend first told me he loved me. Seeing her perform it live was beautiful too. I cried."
38,b,"Trainspotting. The anticipatory opening.  It was part of a soundtrack playlist from my favourite movies. It makes me excited, the beat picks me up. I kinda want to run or jump around to it. Not particularly. Like I said, it is from one of my favourite films trainspotting but other than that I don't relate to it much."
39,a,The intro is very haunting so I picture a dark club with red lights that flicker through the club..  I love BeyoncÃ©.. her music makes me feel like anything is possible.. makes me fee more positive and stronger about myself. The song is about a girl who works her hardest and pushes her self to numerous limits so she can get the best out of life but it's never enough.. So somehow it's pushing me to go finish my degree and work my hardest to get the life I want.. however it is sang in quite a sexual manner so people's views about the song may differ.. Not sure.. It's simply a powerful song
39,b,I think about the first moment when you supposedly meet the love of your life and you say 'hello'.. Again.. I love BeyoncÃ© and majority if not all of her music.. It kind of gives me hope.. that there could be a moment in life when you meet the person that you're supposed to be with and you might know by simply saying 'hello' Not sure.. haven't found that person yet.. so maybe when I do I'll have a relationship with this son because I'll understand better what she means. 
40,a,"It reminds me of singing at Christmas time and my childhood in a choir. /Good memories singing /Good memories, pleasant music/Yes - it is a piece I sang many times as a child"
40,b,Christmas\The album was a gift\I don't really like this version of silent night. It is a bit too polite. \No. It just happens to be on an album that was given to me.
41,a,Dancing in a pub/Because it pleases me/Because I love the song/tes
41,b,Cold time \Mood of the track\Beacuse it is charming\yes
42,a,Seeing them in concert /So I can run to it /I enjoy this track during running as it is very upbeat /Not really it's just a motivator
42,b,Revision playlist \I like the whole album which was uploaded including this song \It's a good uplifting sing a long song \No its just enjoyable to listen to
43,a,"Ah, not quite what I fancied just now.... can't remember -- it's part of a playlist I made many years ago but still return to often.  It's quite an eclectic mix of tracks in the playlist ... this gives a bit of downtime ... it's very beautiful ... has 'missing' inner parts in the harmony that I can add for myself ... not particularly ... If I stop to think about it I can associate events with it (playing it on the piano at home, listening to it in a concert once half a life-time ago, and imagining the performer groaning his way through some of the other tracks on the disc) but I don't usually pay it so much attention! "
43,b,"Unusual to have another classical track picked out (relatively few are classical in this playlist) I love string quartets .... shostakovich 8 is one I've played ...  I would actually say my level of enjoyment of the track varies quite a bit -- I love the sense of a small group of people pulling together... on the other hand it can be a bit distracting if I'm listening in the background while doing something else.  Yes, I suppose so -- had a great evening busking through string quartets with friends not that long after my mum died -- seemed the first time I'd really connected with people well and I appreciated that sense of support. "
44,a,It reminds me of my best friend throughout high school as we both loved Aerosmith and always  used to sing along to their songs.  Because it's a really fun song to listen to when played nice and loud! I enjoy it because it's really powerful and fun to sing (or screech out of tune) along with without caring about who's listening! Yes - the band reminds me of my best friend from high school and the many times we spent listening and singing along to Aerosmith and playing their songs on guitar hero on the Wii!
44,b,"It makes me think of being outside and having fun in summer.  I used it to choreograph a dance to when I was the tap teacher in my university dance society.  It's really upbeat so it puts me in a good mood. It's an easy song to sing along with as well.  Yes to an extent, as it reminds me of my time as a tap teacher. "
45,a,Dancing /Lovely uplifting music that creates a good mood and happy that makes me want to dance/I enjoy the track - mentioned above. The fast beat and cheerful voice/No just enjoy listening to the album
45,b,Sam smith and the James Bond film theme song \I down loaded the album as I enjoyed 2 tracks \Well it is a album/ song I enjoy when I want to relax. I usually skip the track when I am driving as I feel I cannot sing a long. \No it is a album track that I have acquired by opportunity
46,a,"Relaxing, contemplative, interesting pleasing drum line, prayerful, emotional cello and violins /A favorite artist and track. Makes me feel good to listen to. Wanted to share with friends of like taste./See above. Makes me feel relaxed. Evokes a calm emotional response. Interesting from a musical standpoint. Spirtual content./Modern rendition of traditional hymn which I have heard for years."
46,b,Pleasing prayerful\A favorite artist and track I wanted to recall as mybest of\Lyric is prayerful spiritual conversation and the artists words become my own. The musical arrangement is dreamy with cello piano and lead guitar with vibrato. Great tasty drumming.\It is a spiritual faith based song which resonates with my spiritual sensibilities.
47,a,"Good song, haven't heard it for a while!/I have all of The Beatles' albums saved because they're obviously amazing./It's a very good song that I haven't heard for a while./Not really."
47,b,"One of my favourite songs.\It's a band and an album that I really like.\It's the sort of music that I like.\A bit, it's quite an emotional song for me that has some good memories attached."
48,a,"The sadness of drinking too much- the song is about alcoholism/I didn't- when I plugged my iPod into my computer I chose the option ""fill available space with random songs"" and this was one of them/The guitar solo, the lyrics and the vocals suggest that Roger Daltrey is descending into madness. The track is also musically similar in parts to other Who tracks from that period/Yes, because I think I've seen The Who perform it live and all the energy their live shows bring."
48,b,"It's a bit average\I didn't add it, it was one of the random songs/ tracks added to my iPod by iTunes \This is the first time I've actively listened to it. Based on this first listen it's clearly an album filler. Lyrically and musically it's uninspired \No- it's the first time I've listened to it actively"
49,a,"Spinning in a field- arms out enjoying the sun/The cheerful tune and the overall message made me happy/It always bring a smile to my face and makes me want to dance/No, I haven't done anything specifically other than listen to it"
49,b,"It makes me think about Harry Potter\The beat is really enjoyable and I really like the lyrics\Because it is really easy to sing to and is just enjoyable to listen to more than once\No, I haven't done anything with this music before"
50,a,"My 14-year-old self who just bought this album. /I have been a fan of this band for over a decade now, and I can't imagine not having at least some songs of this artist on my device. /The track is lively and powerful, and is sung by one of my favourite vocalists. I also like the combination of string quartet and the typical metal band set-up (i.e. the melodic and rhythmic aspects of this song). /Yes. I bought this album when I was just becoming familiar with the metal genre, and the songs from this album remind me of my time in secondary school and the positive emotions I associate with that time."
50,b,"This song sounds laid-back and jazzy. \This song has been on my laptop for a long time because at some point I wanted to listen to more Herman Brood after I had heard his version of ""My Way."" I haven't listened to any songs by this artist for at least five years. \This song sounds very laid-back and is ""groovy"". I enjoy the big-band instrumentation, the solos between the verses, and the bass-line. \No. I think I've never heard this song before, but I'm glad I've been ""forced"" to listen to it."
51,a,Love It's calm and happy It depends on my mood No
51,b,His voice is beautiful I love this song I like his voice No
52,a,A friend who recommended the track Recommended by a friend Relaxing Reminds me of a friend
52,b,The beat! Like the song Good music. Yes it's a happy song! Also reminds me of the film about a boy.
53,a,The first thing I thought was that this was a funny song. It brought back many funny memories with me friends. /Because it is a song myself and my friends like to dance to. /Because it is a great song that I have many happy memories associated with./Yes - this song makes me laugh and smile every time I hear it!
53,b,I associate this song with the TV show called Glee. It also is a very fun song to sing. \I saved it as part of a cheesy playlist that me and my friends listen to before we go out. \Because it is a good song and I like to sing along to it. \Not really. It is just a song I like to sing and dance to.
54,a,"It's a very calming song which is somewhat sad. I enjoy relaxing music, with acoustic guitar. Also Ryan O'Reilly has long been a favourite of mine. It made me nostalgic and I also think it has beautiful lyrics. Yes. It's a song my first boyfriend and I used to play as we roamed the countryside and one I have listened to many times since then. It has good memories, but is also appropriate for when you're feeling down."
54,b,Urgh. Not this again. I think Emeli Sande has an amazing voice and downloaded her whole album when it first came out. Unfortunately this song happened to be on it. I just think it's her worst track and find it particularly annoying. Mostly because the lyrics are rubbish. No. Not unless you count skipping it as a relationship.
55,a,"The group, dancing./Chosen and added by my daughters./Because it's cheerful./No"
55,b,"A friend from many years ago, who I don't see now.\It's on an album which has some cracking songs on by this band.\Because it's a bit wild.\Yes, a little bit. Because it reminds me of a previous lifestyle from when I was younger."
56,a,"It's a great song by a band from near where I grew up. It's a pretty 'rocking' tune. It's a good song. It feels good to support a band from near my home town.  It has all the hallmarks of the kind of music I listened to a lot growing up and still really appreciate. It has a whole lot of 'drive'.  Yes, but not so much with the track but the band in general. Their progress/success co-incided with a lot of my own personal development over the last couple of years so in some ways their music (including this track) has been a soundtrack to that. "
56,b," I love the over all feel of the track. I choose to save the track as part of my research into 'Tango', in order to gain more musical skills and a greater repertoire.   I think it is something to do with tracks specific musical qualities, being very rhythmical and with some great chords combined with the fact it is different to the usual repertoire of tunes I listen to. I don't really have a specific relationship with the track. Perhaps, the track is part of a greater relationship with music? I often look into other types of music for my own musical development so there is an interesting element of 'challenge' in my short-term relationship with the track.  "
57,a,"Yay, I love this song! Green Day is one of my favorite bands so I have most of their songs saved to my phone It has a really good beat No"
57,b,"That's an awesome song Because it is one of my favourites Because its fun to sing along to Yes, i like to listen to it when i am not stressed out for the irony"
58,a,Listening to the cure with my mum Makes me happy Reminds me of my mum Yes it reminds me of when i was little 
58,b,School Makes me happy Reminds me of being in school with my friends Yeah it reminds me of school and old friends
59,a,"Movies/Good beat/It reminds me of similar Fluke tracks/No,  it doesn't remind me of a specific time, it's just a track I found and enjoyed."
59,b,"Dancing\Reminds me of skiing\Reminds me of an amazing ski trip \No,  it's more about the memories it brings than the track itself."
60,a,"The track makes me feel happy and looking forward to bright memories and what I have to look forward to. It also makes me think about when I discovered Against the Current when they supported All Time Low./I like how the lyrics about there being something beautiful hiding the shadows and the focus on  being optimistic. Chrissy Constanza's voice is exceptional./The song makes me feel happy./The track makes me think of a great night when I saw All Time Low, Good Charlotte and Against the Current in Birmingham with my brother, the weekend when he visited from uni and before I moved to Lancashire."
60,b,"Desiring to get lost in thoughts of a faraway place like the moon.\Waterparks play unique songs and the album Double Dare is one of those albums where each track is different.\Awsten Knight is gifted with a high energy voice and I like the idea of being so happy that you feel like you are lost in heaven. It is up beat and uplifting.\Yes, the song makes me think about pursuing hope and being on a journey to then get to a place where you feel happy. Waterparks have three EPs and released an impressive album at the end of last year. They are achieving their dreams and do not want to stop there. Awsten Knight wants to illustrate children's books and Otto want to get better at unicycling."
61,a,"Cheery, happy, driving Because I like the song, I like old songs Happy tune, nice song No"
61,b,"Happy, sing along, driving, childhood Like the song, happy song, put it on when getting ready or driving Catchy, like the song and beat Yes, just heard it a lot when I was younger been driven around in the car"
62,a,"Reading festival /Playlist for background music /Upbeat, catchy and great guitar riffs/Yes - takes me back to summer and festivals"
62,b,To turn it off \Gathering the others liked it \Boring same generic arctic monkeys song as every other \No- don't like arctic monkeys
63,a,"Remembering when my friend introduced me to the band with this song (amongst others) I enjoys listening to it but also find it a good song for motivation when exercising It is part of a great album, and is different to many other songs that I have Yes, as I remember finding out about the band and listening to their music and really enjoying it with a friend."
63,b,"Jealousy, I know people who have seen the band live and I missed out As part of a great album that I can listen to at any time I enjoy listening to the track as part of the appreciation for the band, the song itself is good but nothing special Not really, it doesnt stir up any emotions of attachment or sentimentality"
64,a,"I feel like dancing. But why did I add this to my playlist? I just heard it and fancied hearing it again. Simple poppy song. No. I don't really know the band, quite like their songs and am more or less (though not entirely) over the idea that they're crap because they're disposable, so I should be a bit ashamed of liking them. I'm not ashamed. Not much."
64,b,"Woo-ooo-ooo-oooooh (which is the first line. I don't know much about this song). I don't remember, other than liking it. Normally I browse new music via Spotify playlists (esp. BBC radio 6, though this didn't come from there) and add the ones I like. This probably came from a dance mix. Simple happy sound. No. It doesn't remind me of anything, I just like it."
65,a,"Driving too fast/It's on my gym playlist, it has a good beat and I love the lyrics./I love the lyrics and enjoy Ed Sheeran's music./Yes. I can relate to much of what it said in the lyrics. It takes me back to a time in my life."
65,b,"Karaoke as a drunk teen!\Happy memories \It makes me sing aloud. This doesn't make anyone else happy as I can't sing in tune, but I love to sing this song really loud! \I associate many memories with this song. It makes me think of people I haven't seen in years and I can taste vodka and black currant when I really listen. Oh happy karaoke days...."
66,a,Brilliance To feel brilliance Enjoy feeling the superb technicality to be connected to superb interpretation Like to feel it
66,b,The combined greatness of Sibelius and Mullova to enjoy it Feel the combined and matched greatness of the composer and the interpreter I like to listen and feel the music 
67,a,"I remember really liking this song when it came out and dancing to it  It has a good beat and is enjoyable to listen to when walking around campus  I like the tune and the beat - it makes me feel happy  Yes - it takes me back to the time when I first heard it and I enjoy memories of last year. Also, my husband and I enjoy the Sean Paul aspects of the song and we usually sing along to it together. "
67,b,"Sitting on the train and listening to this song on the way home from school  It's a song that I have liked for a few years and it makes me feel emotional -  I tend to play it when I am feeling sad and it comforts me It's got a smooth tune and it is emotional (in a good way) Yes - it is a song that I used to listen to during a difficult period in my life: I feel quite emotional when I listen to it (sometimes in a good way, sometimes in a bad way).

68,a,"Summer Vibes Upbeat fun song that makes me want to dance like it's summertime even if it's raining outside It's fun Yes, i've got very positive connotations associated with it, trips to the beach, hanging out with friends just good fun memories"
68,b,"Painting during my Gap Year I have a not so secret love for Justin Bieber and this track is just so good Good beat, the time just flies when you have good tracks to listen to Yes, it reminds me of painting bathrooms with my gap buddy singing at the top of our lungs and dancing around. "
69,a,"reminds me of seeing them live i like the song and my friend introduced me to this band so it reminds me of them i love the band and think its one of their best songs yes, it reminds me of when i saw the band live, and my friend who introduced me to them"
69,b,"Seeing the band live I used to love this band in high school, and listening to old songs i used to like is easy listening for me  I neither enjoy nor not enjoy this track, probably just because there are songs i like more and would rather listen to on my playlist.  yes, it reminds me of when i was in high school and big groups of my friends would go to gigs of this band"
70,a,The patriarchy. (The album the song's from has a song called 'patriarchaeth' on it) I saved the full album. Gwenno is a really interesting artist making modern electronic synthy stuff but singing in Welsh. It's a bit different and quite fun.  It's got lots of cool swirly synth sounds and dulcet welsh vocals Not really. It's from an album I like but nothing more than that.
70,b,Space (the album cover) It came on my discover weekly and I really enjoyed it It's got an anthemic feel to it whilst sounding modern and having some nice weird synth noises No. It came on my discover weekly and I've added it to a couple of playlists but it doesn't particularly mean anything to me
71,a,It reminds me of a safe place after a storm. The thrill is still there but calming down with the cool breeze and the sun shining through the clouds. I like to listen to playlists with songs that have similar tones and beats. This is a nice and relaxing song. It's also an interpretation of a classical tune which sounds cool in a jazz rendition. It's still mid Sunday morning when i'm doing this survey and it's come up as an appropriate track for this time of the day. It has enough variation to lift my mood but still has a calming effect. It gives me a familiar feeling. Maybe because i've known the tune for a long time and it really suits jazzy tones. It reminds me of my youth when i used to follow live jazz music around town.
71,b,"Sunny days, dance and fun. It's part of an uplifting playlist. I don't think i had a specific reason to save the track. I must have heard it somewhere and decided that it suits the mood of the playlist. It gives me positive feeling (even though the lyrics sound depressing, the music totally counteracts it).. I don't have a specific relationship but it feels like a place i'd like to be or hope to find."
72,a,"Dancing  I really like the beat It makes me think about dancing and good nights out, puts me in good mood I suppose Not really, its no different from a lot of tracks I have that make me feel the same thing"
72,b,"My little brother I like the song, it makes me think of summer and it's a fairly unusual song i guess It's quite fun, makes me think of summer Yes I suppose, makes me think of my little brother, he asked if I had it in my playlist once, and I said no, and he seemed so disappointed, so it's been in there since then"
73,a,"Played as a teenager, memories of concerts and friends it is beautiful Evokes happy memories and is familiar and calming played as a teenager"
73,b,"wine, friends, bars trumpet playing is brilliant and it is very uplifting it makes me smile  Not particularly, cant remember when i furst started to appreciate miles davis....feels like background to so many fun times"
74,a,It's really upbeat and quite settling to listen to./I own a number of stereophonic albums and really enjoy their music./It's catchy and easy to sing along to. The song builds up nicely to the chorus sections./No. I just enjoy music by the Stereophonics in general.
74,b,"Holidays, summer, and being away in the sun.\I purchased the song in 2014 when it was released and played it quite a lot during the summer.\It's a happy, upbeat song and remind me of the summer. However, because it's a little bit dated now and I over played it when it was initially released so I don't enjoy it quite as much as I do other songs.\Yes. It reminds me of 2014 during summer."
75,a,Great song.  I bought the album that this track is on as I like the band.  It's a great song by a band I like.  Yes. I've seen the band live and have listened to this track many many times.
75,b,"Manchester I bought the album that this track is on.  It's good but not my favourite Coldplay track. Yes, saw this band live, have more than one album. "
76,a,"That both me and my friend like this artist I saved the whole album, this song included It has a nice melody and I like the harmonies Not a particularly emotional one. I just have a relationship with it because I like it"
76,b,"Songs that I like that are similar to this song, like Bon iver songs It's uplifting, but also mellow It's dynamic.  There are memories, and lots of different instruments, lead vocals and backing vocals. Not an emotional relationship, I just like the song"
77,a,Its where my demons hide its where my demons hide /I like the song/It helps got out frustration /No its a song
77,b,Loude drum beat\Like song\Good base line\No it's a song
78,a,"When I was living in Spain/I love the lyrics,  I found them meaningful and the melody is very lively/Lively music/Yes,  I have been living in Spain for several years and this song is related to my experience over there."
78,b,"My friends\The melody is great\The melody gives you energy\Yes,  One of my friend is a big fan of this group and we went to watch the group perform (for this album).  I remember this night and my friend enthusiasm"
79,a,"I listen to it a lot when I walk, so I thought about the path between my dorm and a bus stop. I find it calming and it picks up my mood. I really like the singer's voice and the piano composition is really good. Yes? I tend to listen to it when i'm walking, so it's one of the first songs that I'll play on my way out of the door."
79,b,"Road trips with my family. Growing up I listened to a lot of my parents music, which influenced my own taste in music, and this is from one of the albums my dad plays in the car. I like the basic melody and the words get stuck in my head. Yeah, because the only times I really hear it is during a road trip so those moments are what immediately jump to mind when I hear this song."
80,a,"Florence's voice I enjoy listening to it. It sounds good and is catchy, so makes me want to sing along. The song is really catchy and has good lyrics & instruments. No, as there aren't any memories I specifically associate with it."
80,b,"The figure of Damon Albarn, singing along. I listen to it often. I really like how the instruments are played and Damon Albarns voice. The track makes me feel good. No, as i don't have any specific memories associated with it."
81,a,It makes me want to move.  Because I like it.  I like the way it makes me feel.  No
81,b,That I'm excited to hear it I like it I like the singer's voice and the structure of the song No
82,a,"It's catchy, and I find the rhythm just makes me want to groove to it /I saved it to my playlist because it's an easy to listen to song, and I like singing the chorus /I enjoy it because as I stated above it's easy to listen to - quite catchy - and I like singing the chorus /No not really, I just like the song"
82,b,"This song feels really deep and lonely to me, but even though it's sad I can relate to it. It feels nostalgic \I love the artist Ed Sheeran, and this song is so relevant to my life being at uni, so that's why it's in my playlist \I love this song, it's so peacefully sad, and it gets me wondering what other people are going through on that transition to uni. I can relate to the song, and even though it feels sad, sometimes it's nice to listen to sad songs to feel that overwhelming emotion \Yes - everything he is singing about I can relate to in a little way. Moving to uni, giving things up, leaving my partner in the first few weeks of uni, and having that struggle of getting over a relationship and keeping it under wraps, not to mention adjusting to a new life"
83,a,"Summer Because it is upbeat; I can sing along to it and it reminds me of summer freedom, sunshine and happiness. I enjoy listening to it because it brings back summer memories and it makes me feel happy. I wouldn't say I do. I like it, but it can get really annoying and I do not find the lyrics that personally meaningful. "
83,b,"Rebellion My friend showed me this song years ago and I really enjoyed the lyrics and the sound of the instruments. I enjoy listening to this song because the lyrics have a personal value to me. It also reminds me of a different chapter of my life and reminds me to reflect back of past decisions.  If I had to justify my relationship with this song in a sentence, it would be ''It just gets me.'' It is difficult to explain things like that, it is a feeling, an emotion. I cannot explain or rationalise it. "
84,a,"Takes me back to lonely times. I think about what a great song it is and wonder if I feel like listening to it on a beautiful day and then I decide no it's okay because I'm not feeling too lonely right now./it's a powerful song that i have often been glad to hear./It's a really well composed song and it's so authentic it really grabs me by the heart. It also has great musical ideas/I do, it reminds me of being away at school and feeling lonely and helpless"
84,b,"oh hey cool beat\I just have most of this artist's discography on my phone\it's pretty rad, lots of energy, neat beats and i feel a sort of comforting and friendly feeling at the sound of this artist's voice.\I don't really know this song, so it's only the friendly familiar voice of the singer, and her style, that I feel connected to."
85,a,"I need to add this to another playlist Part of a music bundle The motif is one I like No, I just like listening to it"
85,b,"I don't recognise is Part of a CD It's alright, but not exactly my music taste. Nope. Didn't know it was on the playlist."
86,a,"Classy and cool. It's intelligent rather than emotional, but it's so smart it's impossible not to like. I had the greatest hits album and transferred it to MP3 some years ago The band are good players and it's a proper, grown-up song No, It's the sort of music my brothers like. They are both more interested in technical music than I am (I'm normally a more, straight-up rock fan). I know they would both like it and if they like it, I tend to, at least respect it."
86,b,"Lovely memories of my son listening to music in his bedroom. It was from a CD my son had. He introduced me into the Chili Peppers. Happy memories of when my children were at home and starting to find themselves. Not particularly this track but, with this band, definitely. I took my son to see them play a couple of times."
87,a,I want to skip it I used to like Muse's earlier albums Makes me slightly embarrassed at how bad Muse became. No - barely ever listen to it.
87,b,"It's relaxing Enjoyed the first xx album, enjoy electronica style music - so wanted to try Jame xx's album.  It's peaceful & relaxing Only as a listener, nothing deeper."
88,a,"It's very chill and relaxing, whilst still being interesting and inspiring. It's a track by an artist I like. It's unique and creative, both lyrically and musically. Yes; at the point of adding this track to my device, the artist hadn't yet released an album and I wanted to listen to their music a lot and this was one of the tracks I downloaded."
88,b,"It's a track that starts very calm but becomes very dramatic; I like it a lot. It's a track from one of my favourite albums, Ariel. I love the feeling of life the music has, it's beautiful, enticing, rich and intricate; it makes me feel like I'm in the middle of a story and full of possibilities. Yes.
This track is on the album that I listen to with my family when we take the Christmas decorations down and pack them away, all together. It's a tradition we have every year, ever since the album was released. It reminds me of these happy times."
89,a,"Solitude, melancholy, patience, night./I own all of Mogwai's music, so I suppose it's because I love Mogwai./I like post-rock generally, and Mogwai more than most similar bands. The track has a very subtle, almost ambient synth intro, takes its time to create an atmosphere, before indulging in the fairly typical post-rock crescendo. It's not very long for its kind, which I think makes it harder to create that feeling, too. /Not a specific one with this song, no, more with the band. I lived in Glasgow so Mogwai were the ""local"" post-rock gods in a way."
89,b,"Laughter? Dancing? Actually, it's probably an endearing ""Awww, it's Paul Simon.""\I've got two versions of this. One on ""Graceland"" and one on the soundtrack to a movie I've never seen called ""Like Crazy."" This is the O.S.T. version. Someone recommended the soundtrack to me.\Paul Simon cheers me up. It's also dancy, in a good way.\Probably just late night drunk dancing in someone's flat."
90,a,"slight calm as the music settles me As I like Paramore's other music so decided to download some of their albums Enjoy the style of music, good singer and nice beat No, its just one of the songs on my phone that I listen to sometimes"
90,b,"It's been a while since I've listened to this song Again, liked some of Adele's songs so added her album to my device As I have not listened to this in a while, would rather listen to other things. Although I will leave the song on if it is played Not really, Just and older song I used to listen to more"
91,a,"It's good for shutting up my brain because it's loud It's a good song I like it  It's a comforting song when I'm stressed No, I just like listening to it "
91,b,"I would normally skip it as soon as I see it I just put the whole album on  It's a good song I just am never in the mood for it  No, I don't listen to it enough "
92,a,"Fighting and war I thoroughly enjoy the music produced by Raubtier, and I find the story behind this song to be particularly ""moving"". Against the backdrop of heavy metal and gruff vocals, we hear a story about abused and bullied children who, through their determination to continue and fight against their adversaries, were granted a place in Valhalla upon their deaths.  As above.  This question is far from clear. Are you asking if this song has personal resonance for me? To some degree yes, albeit far from the suffering endured by the central character. "
92,b,"Nothing concrete, but rather an abstract notion of ""epicness"". The sounds in this song are impressive and, for want of a better word, ""epic"". Great song, great vocals, great energy.  As above Again, I don't really understand the question. Presumably as before, does it have emotional resonance, then no, I just enjoy the operatic nature of the track. "
93,a,"Smooth, nice song that's calm and cute.  Because I downloaded all of Ed Sheerans songs because I like all the other music of his.  It's calming and just nice to listen to while doing work or just listening to it.  Nope, it is just a lovely song that comes on. "
93,b,"Calming, soothing song.  It's a cover by Boyce Avenue, and he's an artist that I like working to and to calm down to because its soothing.  It soothes me and helps me concentrate sometimes, but other times it can make me sleepy. It really depends on my mood.  Not really, its just by an artist who sings slow songs and I enjoy it. "
94,a,"Peaceful, tranquility, calmness/I enjoy calm solo piano music to either read to or sleep to /It's a beautiful piece and I enjoyed that it got randomly selected /No. Although I have the album saves I've never actively listened and know that particular piece."
94,b,"Passion, emotion, intelligence, technical, happy\Beethoven is my favourite and string quartets are my favourite\The Beethoven string quartets are my absolute all time favourite pieces of music, his story is amazing, his skill unmatched. There's no better form of music than a string quartet. The razumovsky quartets are particularly furious and emotional which I enjoy.\Yes. The first string quartet I saw live performed the first razumovsky quartet which I remember well after around 3 years"
95,a,"How gorgeous the lyrics are - I used to listen to this track over and over on car journeys. I love Michael BublÃ© and so I bought an album of his and put it on my iPod - this song just happened to be on there and I became acquainted with it that way. It instantly makes me smile because I know how sweet the lyrics are; it's the most beautiful love song but you can really dance to it and that's just a perfect combination. Not really - it doesn't mean anything particularly personal to me, it's just a great song"
95,b,"It makes me cry so I get ready to feel tears! It's absolutely beautiful and Kate Rusby's voice and music is perfect for complete relaxation time. It's just a beautiful song, and it has an amazing soft brass instrumental that just takes my breath away My dad introduced me to Kate Rusby and I listen to this track with my brother a lot and then we talk about how beautiful it is, so it relates to family a lot for me"
96,a,"It comes to my mind the first day when I heard the song and decided to save it. It also come to my mind some memories related to it, such other moments where I really enjoyed listening to it. As it sounds I also create expectations of what I am gonna hear and how good the singer is./It is a very good song, it has a very unique vibe/ style. The singer/ vocals are just incredible. /I enjoy it because the singer/ vocals are incredible. It is a unique song in terms that is difficult to hear to songs of similar style. I really like the  base with beatbox and I am in love with the singer and vocals. The melody is so moving as well, it is kind of sad but makes me feel good./I guess I do, only for the mere fact that I've listened to it quite a lot. I have a relationship based on all the times I've listen to it. Now I know the song perfectly but it has not been always like that, I need listening to it repeatedly to understand it as well as I do. Unfortunately, I've listen to it so much that now"
96,b,"HAPPINESS. Excitement, joy, emotion! I actually felt so happy that this song appeared, I just love it!\This is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard in my life. It makes me cry. \This song is just beautiful, words are to limited to describe how good it is. I think is one of the best songs I've ever heard in my life. The singer is just amazing, the music the version of the original songs is just beautiful. This songs always moves me.\I do. I remember the first day I heard it, I was not sure about what was it because it is not my style at all, then I remember loving it and being very surprise: ""How can I like something like this""? is classical music... I remember telling my father, who said that Henry Purcell is incredible. Since then, each time when I hear this song I feel completely moved. It is not a song for every day or every moment, only for very unique and especial moments."
97,a,The death of bassist John Wetton It's one of the albums of my youth Nostalgia See above
97,b,Normally I would skip this artist because my wife can't stand him but she's at work ! Peter Hammill is my favourite artist There is something about his work which connects with me see above
98,a,"My friend Tim, who told me about this album./Tim told me to./It's the best song on the album and has a 'good hook'./It reminds me of some drunken nights in our old flat."
98,b,"My friend Matt, who is the artist responsible.\I bought this album on bandcamp to help my friend out\It's beautiful and personal.\I do, as I know Matt quite well so can picture his process of writing and recording this."
99,a,"It's calming, reminds me of summer driving Because I like the band, and its a lovely song It has a nice beat, its easy to listen to and it's soothing no, it doesnt have any relationship to an event in my life that i associate it with"
99,b,"Drinking alcohol I like the song I like the artist, the song is good Yes, reminds me of pre drinks from first year"
100,a,learning to play guitar at school  Copied from cd. Nostalgia  Yes. The Bends was one of the first albums that started my close relationship with music of my own choice
100,b,"It's a song I like but don't know that well. I think I should listen to it more often! I downloaded the album as when I was younger I was big fan of his previous band, Idlewild I enjoy hearing the singer's voice again, and he has mellowed a little, as have i Not this track, but this artist"
101,a,"Seeing her play it live at Somersault festival I like the album It's a good song - not my favourite on the album, but I love singing along to her songs Somewhat. It's a song I would seek out when I'm feeling moody, but it's not a top ""go to"" track"
101,b,Nothing! IT's from the album Ain't gonna Hush and I feel like it's an album I ought to listen to but rarely doG n/a No. I haven't listened to it enough
102,a,summer /the song make me Reminesce about life   /i like the melody and vocalist the way the song sounds just makes you feel things you wouldn't feel without it playing /i wouldn't say i have a relationship with it but i do like to list to it when it come on
102,b,summer \i liked the combination of chill vibes with a more hype beat drop** \i like how the beat drops and almost catches you off guard because it sounds like it going to be a more calm song \no relationship in particular but it was apart of the first playlist i very made along with the first song
103,a,It's not an English song I enjoy the upbeat feel  I enjoy the band and is one of my favourite songs from them  No
103,b,"Haven't listened to it in a while  It was on an album and I liked the other songs  It's ok, but I normally skip it as I don't like it as much as other songs from the album No"
104,a,This song is annoying saved a whole album and this was in it im not a big fan of Ariana grande no
104,b,I like this song- very up beat heard it on the charts liked it and saved it as it was up beat its up beat and I like up beat music no
105,a,"Feeling relaxed It is a feelgood, relaxing song which is nice to listen to in the background whilst I do other activities  Because it is a nice, chilled song in a genre of music I generally enjoy No, it's just a song by a band I usually enjoy and I would listen to most of their music"
105,b,"Music gigs A new single by my favourite band This is my favourite band I have seen multiple times and really enjoy listening to Yes, this reminds me of going to gigs and listening to this band with some of my closest friends I don't get to see that often "
106,a,"A gig that I went to in December and seeing this song played live. I wanted to have the band playing before I went to the aforementioned gig because it makes you connect with the music live. It is really upbeat instrumentally. Yes. Lyrically, it is very proud. I am quite nihilistic and Brian Molko writes songs that I resonate with."
106,b,"A film that the song is from. I see the scene from The Book of Life. It's an animated film. Very vivid and colourful. I loved the film so I downloaded the entire soundtrack. The track is both happy and sad. The song is an apology but it is hopeful as well. Sometimes, I enjoy it. Sometimes, it makes me emotional. I can listen to it, when I feel weak or when I feel strong. It is just a very poignant song because the message transcends beyond the film. I do now because I'm having to think a lot about forgiveness."
107,a,"I like it./Album was recently released and heard a friend listening to it and liked it so I added it./Because I like the lyrics and the beat, plus it hasn't been overplayed like a lot of pop songs are./No, can't really relate personally to the lyrics but I still enjoy listening to it."
107,b,"Should I skip it? I like the beginning but it gets kind of annoying.\Because I like other songs by Chance The Rapper so I thought I'd give this one a chance. I quite like the beat but don't really like the featuring artists.\I enjoy the first half but then it kind of gets repetitive and I'm not keen on the featuring artists or their verses in the song.\No, don't identify with the lyrics as they don't seem to be that meaningful to me, haven't really listened deeply to them though as I don't listen to the song much."
108,a,"Christmas time, teaching it to children on the piano, why on earth do I still have this song still on my iPod?  For doing a Christmas gig where I needed to provide Christmas songs as part of background music. The track itself is a great catchy tune but it has lost its appeal after teaching it over and over again.  However I love the Jackson 5 on the whole so I will still feel good listening to it. Yes.  I usually get a ""love/hate"" relationship with songs I have to learn and teach.  I'll could go mad with it still on my head hours after."
108,b,"Flashback to my first ""Now that's what I call music"" compilations from my childhood and school discos.  I can't help but tap my foot! It's a guilty pleasure and I love nostalgic emotions from the song.  Plus it's just a great tune, it hits everything I like. It reminds me of when I was first getting into music, especially listening to cheesy pop tunes over and over again.  It's extremely catchy but not following the usual commercial musical vibes of the time.  The lyrics make me feel uplifted.  Plus I love the epic over the top guitar solo. Yes but it only makes an appearance every so often when I need a boost and satisfy that nostalgia moment fix."
109,a,"It makes me think about my dad, it's one of his favourite songs  I like the song and also because it's something my dad got me in to  I just think it's a good song  Yes- it's a personal song, because it makes me thinks about my dad and our relationship "
109,b,"Waiting to hear my favourite part of the song  I saved it because I really like the band  I like the song, I like how I can sing along to it  No- I wouldn't say I have a relationship with it, I just like the song "
110,a,Summer and Happiness  Makes me feel good Makes me fell good and like dancing No
110,b,Catchy good feeling Love it and like this band Good to listen or dance to Reminds me of lying in the sun on holiday and listening to this on my ipod
111,a,"The club in stoke, names sugarmill Yes Good song, my main genre of music, catchy.  Not really. Other than being my genre of music, i dont listen to the band otherwise"
111,b,"My dad loves this song, also the first song i got on my vinyl Because i like the happy mondays. Its got good rhythm and is a song i like to play when im getting ready to go out o a club Good music Yes, my dad loves it and played it growing up also the band members live on my street back home so the band is still big"
112,a,"80s nostalgia  Part of an album I downloaded for Christmas background music Warm feelings, memories of my youth, Christmas feeling No. No special memories associated with this track, like listening to it with a special person or over and over again during a certain time of life."
112,b,"The faces of my friends whose song this is I love all this group's songs, so this song was added as part of one of their albums. Love the sound of the language, the meaning of the words, it makes me want to move with the music I know the artists personally and can see their faces in my mind, smiling at me as I listen. I have also performed the song myself, and it was a very beautiful, emotional experience."
113,a,"Definitely the best version of this song  I love to sing along to it  Nice guitar, Jeff Buckley's voice is beautiful. Soft but still moving.  Yes, me and my dad used to listen to this song together in the car. Buckley is our last name, which means a lot to me as it shows we're family (I'm adopted). "
113,b,"Interesting voice, is that a ukelele? It's fun, can have a little jig to it  Nice voice, good melody, can sing along to it.  Yes, I have a video of my nephew dancing to this when he was 5 so about 6 years ago. He lives quite far away so I don't see him often. This song reminds me of him. "
114,a,"A state of mind to program in  When working on my IT projects I like to have music that puts me in a trance.
This track is used in the movie ""The Social Network"" and I adore the scene.
the movie is not very good but it inspires me to keep on working on programs/games It calls me down and gives me focus No"
114,b,War\I enjoyed the movie and its soundtrack a lot\calms my mind down\no
115,a,"family It's by a bluegrass band I have seen perform twice with my husband, and we often play their CDs in the car with the family. Great musicianship, love the fiddle, good memories of listening to it both live and with my children and husband. Yes, see above."
115,b,"Love Again, I saw him perform live twice and loved the man for his music and poetry.  I love the sentiment of the song. I love the deep, gravelly sound of Leonard Cohen's voice, and the beautiful lyrics and melody.  Yes, as per my earlier answer - I saw him perform twice here in Brighton and was completely bowled over especially after the first concert, because I had never really listened to his music before.  And my husband put it on a compilation CD for me once."
116,a,"Being in secondary school with my friends  It brings back memories.
I like the song.  I associate the song with my early years at secondary school. I also saw Scouting for girls at a concert which was specifically for Girl Guiding. 
It is upbeat and it has a good drumbeat. It is also recognisable by the heartbeat sound effect at the beginning and end of the song.  Yes, it brings back memories. "
116,b,I'm not sure that I know the song. However then the singing entered and I recognised it.  It was on a compilation cd of love songs that I put on my iPod when I first bought my iPod. It's relaxing.  No
117,a,"it's a catchy tune /I like the artist and this song is nice to sing along to /i like the song lyrics /No, don't have any particular event in my life attached to this song"
117,b,I love the harmonies and melodies \It's my favourite song by The Calling \it's fun to play along to on guitar and sing along with\it reminds me of the series 'the chronicles of narnia'
118,a,"Love, liveliness, infatuation/I love how upbeat it is, how different it is to modern music. I love the vivacity of it and of course Armstrong's rich voice./It puts me into a good mood./Yes. As I said it can change my mood, make me feel like dancing and transport me into a different era."
118,b,"Religion, self restraint, peace\I find it calming and I like the Beatles\I like how gentle the rhythm and vocals are. \Yes. When I'm mad or stressed about something or someone I tend to listen to it and it calms me."
119,a,"How the words parallel how I feel right now. /I was making a playlist to listen to while writing my dissertation /It felt sad the way I was feeling /""Yes."
119,b,"How much I like this song....""oooh I like this song:)"" \I like the song. It reminds me of happy parts of my childhood. My mom use to clean the house and listen to it. \I like the sound of the music. I like the tone of the song and the words. \Yes. It makes me think of happy times as a child."
120,a,"Lyrical content. Very pleasant. romantic but charmingly innocent. Not overly poetic. Catchy mantra.  As a musician, I needed to learn the song for a gig. (wedding I believe) I often learn songs using spotify and it has remained in my playlist ever since. It's really touching song. -Strong reverbs, percussion, and acoustic instruments produce a very calming quality about the song. 

-Melody serves as a very effective hook- it's receptive and supported by simple triadic harmony. 

-Interesting rhythmic feel; the verse primarily features only percussion style drums rather than a formulaic drum kit pattern. In contrast, the drum kit chorus groove is minimalistic and slightly unusual, featuring only bass drum on the downbeat and hit on the off-beat. This gives a very light bouncy, quite joyful feel in the chorus. 

-Lyrics are romantic but refreshingly innocent

-Overall a very warm mix Yes. I Learnt to play the song in preparation for a gig I had. This is why I was introduced to the song."
120,b,"I've not listened to this song in a very long time. Very catchy pre-chorus and chorus hook.  It's a good song. I like listening to it. Nostalgia of teenage years. Its catchy, happy, american pop-punk. Musically very simple, but satisfying.  Yes, I used to listen to Jimmy Eat World a lot as a teenager. Music from this period in your life has a tendency to stay with you in a far more meaningful way. 

As individuals, the memories that we have are fundamentally attached to our senses (and vice-versa). We therefore associate sounds, images, smells etc. with particular memories, and therefore emotions. In this instance; teenagers tend to be more emotional and more emotional driven. Songs that we regularly listen to through this part of our lives tend to prompt a far more emotional response upon re-listening. (i didn't quite know what ti di with this as it is factual rather than their reaction)"
121,a,Happy bouncy eurotrash. /Meaningless. Easy listening good to run and drive to/All of the above/No
121,b,Fun Punchy. Good beat \Like the artist and their music   Heard this on radio and bought the album as it's fun\As above\No
122,a,"The beat I save the whole album The beat is uplifting No, it's just a normal song for me"
122,b,"Guitar  I enjoy the music It is nice No, it's just a song to me"
123,a,"The album that the track comes from was reccomeded by my girlfriend It bring back nice memories  I enjoy the category of music that it comes under and its also a very happy song Yes, the albu (unfinished sentence provided)"
123,b,The album that the track is from was recommended by my girlfriend It brings back good memories  I like indie style music and this track would fall under that category  It was recommended by my girlfriend
124,a,"It's a song that I really like  It's one of my favourite songs of all time  its easy to listen to, and its calming  yes, it is able to make me calm whenever it is on "
124,b,"It's a classic song  I love Whitney's music  its a song that everyone will sing along to  yes, it makes me think of my family as we always listen to Whitney's music together."
125,a,"There's a real spacial awareness; quiet, delicate and comforting.  I think it's a very beautiful track off one of my favourite Talk Talk albums. It's part of a bigger playlist composed of similar songs.  I very much enjoy this song, how it slips from dark brooding sections and then eases into these warm, restrained choruses that hint at something far larger than you can ever put into words  Yep, I'd say it's the first Talk Talk track I really got into. I was advised to check them out after chatting about Bon Iver's second album and similarities between the two. It's a playlist of favourite songs. "
125,b,"Reminds me of All Things Must Pass by George Harrison and working in an office in Waterloo. This song was played most mornings for about a month after its release, puts me in a happy, reflective mood.  Brilliant song, wanted to be able to listen to it offline, any morning.  I think it's wonderfully orchestrated, it doesn't feel overcomplicated or overblown, feels like opening the curtains, fills me with some faith  Yes, as mentioned above. I was never massive on Beck but this introduced me to his recent work and then I went back and got into to the earlier albums. "
126,a,"Gathering with friends  One of my favorites  A great song from a great album  Yes ,I didn't listened Dylan for a while and then I discovered this album "
126,b,"A soundtrack  I like la
Sonnambula It's like a journey to other era  Generally opera brakes the routine.."
127,a,Whether I will be judged by the people conducting the survey for listening to this song I downloaded the whole album  It's musical quality and chill feel No
127,b,It's a cute song  I downloaded the whole album  It's a nice song Not really 
128,a,"Big, powerful, loud song that feels like beating your chest and shouting/I like it, it lifts my mood and is energising/Good beat, good riffs, lifts my mood. /Not particularly"
128,b,"That it's one of my favourites and has been for nearly 30 years. Fun, fast, sleazy and upbeat.\Long time favourite band, album and track. Originally owned it on cassette.\Lots of fun, lifts my mood\Yes. It was featured on a film called ""The decline of western civilisation part 2: The Metal Years"". The film was a big influence on me as a teenager, and this song and band in particular, on that film, changed my music taste (forever!)"
129,a,"Excellent vocals, really catchy chorus, brilliant guitar work from Blackmore, good driving song. Chorus had me hooked for weeks, listened to it on repeat. I automatically want to sing along, really gets stuck in my head. This genre of music really communicates with me, just love the way the song is put together. To reiterate a point, the chorus is  really catchy. Yes - Regardless of the situation, regardless of my current mood, this song makes me forget everything negative and put that smile on my face. After battling depression for a number of years it became apparent to me about how I can use music to alter my mood. Be it for good, or for bad. This is an example of the former. "
129,b,"The notes and phrasings Guthrie plays, where does he get his ideas from?! In admiration of Guthrie's musical genius! He sounds like no other guitarist. I don't often enjoy solo guitar music, however the way he plays makes it very easy and interesting to listen to. No - although I admire the playing, it doesnt stir much emotion within me."
130,a,"Dancing on a night out  Pre-drinks music  Upbeat, easy lyrics, catchy No - just a song that I like "
130,b,"Her political stance against donald trump  like Katy perry music  Good rhythm, catchy  No - just a song I like "
131,a,my daughter singing it in the car/so my children can listen to it/I wouldn't listen to it on my own but it makes me happy that it makes my children happy!/no
131,b,I hate Adele's singing voice\I arranged the song for a choir and kept the original to learn the words\I don't particularly like the song\yes- it was sung by my choir in the first concert we performed
132,a,"Groovy hip hop with a mix of soul/It makes me wanna dance/It has a cool meaning behind the lyrics/No, its just another song to put me in a good mood"
132,b,"Deep house\I like the electronic beat\It makes me wanna dance\No, just found it one day on soundcloud"
133,a,"Fun Combines two of my favourite genres of music - ska and Cuban salsa. I have all of Ska Cubano's albums on my iPod. It's quite summery and makes me think of hot summer nights. In a way - I've met the band backstage and wrote a biography for its saxophonist at her request. However, this is not one of my favourite tracks of theirs."
133,b,"Funky! I have all of Prince's albums on my iPod. I was a massive fan of his from the age of about 12 to 22 in particular, but I still go back to his songs quite frequently, especially after he died last year. It's a fairly early Prince track from the era when he played everything himself. It's relatively unsophisticated compared to much of his later work, but has all the classic Prince hallmarks - funky bass, falsetto vocal, early 80s synths! No. It's not in any way a favourite Prince track and probably not one I would ever select to play specifically (unless I were playing the album in its entirety) but it's still nice to hear it on shuffle!"
134,a,"Listening to Elvis on roadtrips by myself and singing along with the radio Really like the song & Elvis in general I love Elvis' voice and this song in particular has a nice melody and orchestration Not particularly, just a song I like listening to on car journeys etc"
134,b,"Learning to play the song on piano about 10 years ago Love love love Fleetwood Mac, one of my favourite bands Really nice melody and Stevie Nicks voice is great. Moving story within the song Yes, love playing it on piano, a lot of repetitive scale patterns which makes it easy enough to play"
135,a,the beat and catchy rhythm. I like how it sounds Herd it in a cafe and wanted to listen to it again.  One of my favorite songs no
135,b,"the hip hop vibe. makes me want to dance liked how it sounded, also was a popular song once i like how it sounds good song to do hw to and work out to.  use it in a power point for end of the year swimming montage"
136,a,Freedom Makes me feel better Easy to listen to In a way as it makes me feel better
136,b,Being 15 again and singing with my friends to paramore It's a good song and enjoyable I know all the words and can sing along Yes as it reminds me of being with my friends
137,a,Cheesy 1980's goodness. Phil Collins is an excellent singer./It's a good balance with the rest of the tracks on the list. I usually add songs as and when I think about them./Well I secretly enjoy the track a little bit. It's upbeat and has a nice synth track which contrasts against some of the progressive rock in the playlist./Not in particular. I usually pick tracks individually based on mood. The shuffle function is a rare choice.
137,b,A great nineties rock track. Definitely worth a listen. High tempo. Great introduction.\Because it's one of those songs I never get tired of.\I feel the band has produced some excellent songs and are severely underrated. It's a driving and motivating kind of song.\Supergrass were a band that was part of the British music scene when I was very young and I have had an attachment because it's what I grew up with.
138,a,"One of my current favourites so was very glad it was the first when I shuffled.  I discovered it on Spotify and I don't have premium so was unable to listen to whenever I wanted too, so I downloaded it so that I can listen to it whenever.  I love the beat- the piccato strings are different in a popular music song. It's easy to listen too. I love the artists voice as it's unique. Also like the lyrics a lot.  Yes- I have a past with depression, anxiety and eating disorders so have a lot of 'issues'. The songs lyrics just highlights that we all have issues so makes me feel a lot better about it. It's sort of empowering. "
138,b,"The catchiness of it.  Really liked the beat of the song and wanted to be able to listen to it when I choose rather than through Spotify where you have unlimited skips and cannot choose a specific song.  It's very catchy, makes me want to move/tap my foot/dance. It's a happy song and very summery so perfect for in the car at this time of year.  Not really. I'm definitely an introvert so I like to go back into my 'cocoon' "
139,a,"It's one of the less interesting Gershwin covers on the album./If I like most of the songs on an album, I will usually have the entire album on my phone, even if some of the tracks aren't as interesting or enjoyable as others. /I think Brian Wilson chose his favourite Gershwin tracks even though on some of them he had fewer ideas than others to bring to them./Not really. It's not helped by the fact that the song is meant to potray a character in a larger work and I don't find it stands up well outside performances of Porgy and Bess as a whole."
139,b,"Post-war British confidence.\I'm interested in British television history and the music used by television companies is part of that.\It's tuneful, upbeat and has a distinct sense of its time.\Yes. It makes me think of the Britain my parents grew up in and how much its confidence was real and how much of it was whistling in the dark. It's pretty cheerful, too. Good music for setting out on a journey in the morning."
140,a,"When the song was released I was single and in my mid twenties and was enjoying working in a bar in the evening and going out a lot.  It's an uplifting happy song, good for singing loudly in the car.  It makes me happy.  Not particularly, it was one of many I played regularly at that time. "
140,b,It's a powerful and emotional song about a break up which could have applied many times over the years.  It's a recent song I'd heard on the radio and I enjoyed it so downloaded it.  I sing it in the car and imagine I am singing it to one of my exes.  Not particularly. The emotion in it just reminds me of how I have felt sometimes when a relationship breaks down. 
141,a,It bring's back memories of the show and the song is up beat.  Because i enjoyed the show and i like listening back to the soundtracks after the show. If the show is good then i often purchase or download the songs.   Up beat and fun.  Its a good track and brings back good memories
141,b,I can't really remember the song.  Because i like a variety of music and i like olly murs.  Up beat  Its a good song
142,a,The vibe Puts me in a good mood The lyrics and how it sounds No
142,b,"Usher Vibe The meaning No, its old school jam"
143,a,"The first thing that comes into my mind about this track is the word ""Groove"". The music is mid-tempo so it's not quite a danceable track, nor a ballad for slow dancing. I chose to save this track to my device because I heard it on the radio in my car and thought it was enjoyably simplistic and reminiscent of the artist, Prince - my favorite artist - due the singer's use of his falsetto for most of the song. Also, I thought it would be a good song for me to learn and add to my performance repertoire as a performing artist. I enjoy this song because it's easy to sing along with easily and is reminds me of older R&B music of which I am very fond. I have a relationship to this track because as a performing musician I have added it to my performing repertoire and the lyrics remind me of how it has felt (nerves, anxiety, etc.) when I have gathered the courage to approach someone romantically."
143,b,"The first thing that comes to my mind is sex. I chose to save this track because it was made by one of favorite girl groups. I enjoy listening to this track because the chord progression, though repetitive, is interesting along with the instrumentation. I have a relationship with this track because it comes from one of the first CD's I ever listened to as a kid."
144,a,My Brother/Makes me happy/Love the story-telling and the rhythm/Yes - I have learnt to sing it. I add my own style to it.
144,b,Escaping my troubles\Reflects my mood\Good to know someone else has felt the same feeling.\Yes. My ex-husband introduced me to this song - in happier times.
145,a,Makes me think of Mr Bean! :)/Because of the reason above! It makes me smile and happy as Mr Bean makes me laugh! (It's  used in the film Mr Beans Holiday)/It's a super tune and makes me smile and la la la along to it!/Only in the fact I associate it with a film and a character I love :)
145,b,"YEAH! Energised.\British Sea Power are one of my favourite bands, and I enjoy pretty much everything they've made! \It makes you feel up beat and ready to go!\Yes in a way, I've seen them live as a band well into double figures now! And this one in particular as it has a french horn part makes me think of when I saw them at the Barbican where all their songs were re done with a brass band, so this one featured at that gig. I always see British Sea Power with my best pal Gav and my fiance Pedro, so again makes me think of them too and in turn makes me feel great!"
146,a,"Glad it was this track as it is one I enjoy Because it is one of my all time favorites Great track Yes, reminds me of when I saw them live, a long time ago"
146,b,"Another good track, not my favorite on that album but still good Saved the whole album. Only save tracks I enjoy No not really just a track on a good album"
147,a,Relaxing track from a totally relaxing album.  Love the album and good for times when need to slow everything down. vocals are amazing No
147,b,I had no idea this was on my phone! I don't recall saving it I quite liked listening to it here ... it's not something I listen to all the time.   Has a celtic feel and that's where my roots lie
148,a,"Remember listening to this at my first live concert  It is one of my all time favourite songs and makes me smile  This track cheers me up anytime, and if I have a long drive or stressfull day I can turn the volume right up and sing my loudest  I have been a Bon Jovi fan  since I was young, and due to my old job I got to stand on stage at Old Trafford with them while they sang this track live !!!"
148,b,"It reminds me of my wedding day it was the track that my husband had chosen for me to walk in to and it was a surprise.  It is one of my favourite songs and made me cry !!!!! It has happy memories of my wedding day  It is totally different to my normal music choices as I do really like rock tracks, however, this is a special song that reminds me of when I first met my now husband Yes - it always makes me happy if I'm feeling a little sad."
149,a,"1970's glam rock/one of my favourite songs from my favourite era of music/it is just a great song, different to the norm/no, it is just a song i enjoyed listening to in my teens and still enjoy know."
149,b,"energetic, fun, rebellious\great tune, meaningful lyrics, just enjoyable song\loud, raucous, helps to keep me feeling young\no, it is just a song i liked when i first heard it and still enjoy now"
150,a,Nostalgia/I love 80s pop music/I grew up in the 80s so it reminds me of when I was first discovering music (and MTV)/No
150,b,I don't know this song\I liked one or two tracks from the album so downloaded the whole thing\I don't think I've heard it before. I rarely listen to an album start to finish even if I've bought the whole thing\No. It's a new song to me.
151,a,"The music video, I remember watching it and loving the song even more.  I like how upbeat it is to drive to It's got a strong message, a great video & I can relate to the words  Yes, someone special to me introuduced me to it "
151,b,"Gym workout  To pump me up, for work, gym, anything  I only enjoy listening to it when I'm in that mood otherwise I find it too aggressive. Yes, it's my motivation song"
152,a,"A trip to France i took with my family about 3-4 years ago. I binged the album while we were there I really like the track, and Mika is one of my favourite artists It's very much in my music taste, i like the lyrics and the backing track Yes, as previously stated I binged the album during a trip to france and it reminds me of that"
152,b,"My friend Chris I needed music for a long drive i was taking with my friend and its one of his favourite songs It makes me happy, reminds me of our friendship Yes it was introduced to me by my friend chris and it reminds me of my friendship with him that grew from the last year"
153,a,"I like the energy of the song. The artist and her music style are one I was fond of for a long time and grew up with. It has a good energy, good lyrics and I love singing along with it. Yes, it is a song I used to listen to a lot when I was in my late teens."
153,b,"Loved this film! (it's part of the Tangled soundtrack) I loved the soundtrack to this film, and so I saved the entire soundtrack in my music library. It's a very happy, energetic and catchy song that makes me want to sing along. Yes, Tangled is to date one of my favourite Disney films, and the music is really good and always lifts my mood."
154,a,Got a groove. Makes me want to move. /Recommended by family member /Unusual. Neat lyrics and beat. /No. Unfamiliar to me but I like it.
154,b,Holidays\Like the artist and I like holiday music. \Nice version of a familiar song. \Yes. I like jazz and i like christmas music.
155,a,"First time I saw the movie Nightmare before Christmas and a related theme party with friends I really like it I find very interesting and creative musically. Yes

as I said i can recall different moments of my life related to this song"
155,b,"Death I really love it and listen to it often I find it very soothing and consoling Working with people` with mental health problems I often feel the song is a depiction of mental and psychological suffering. 
It talks about suicide but with a very tender and not judgmental way, acknowledging the pain of everyone involved"
156,a,The beginning of my relationship  I like the song  It makes me feel nostalgic  Yes- it's the first album that my other half introduced me to. He went on holiday for two weeks and I listened to nothing but this album until he returned because it made me feel close to him. 
156,b,"Nothing much- as a musician, I focus solely on each musical element of the song if there are no memories associated with the song I liked the song  I think it has a good melody and emotional aspect to the song, I also enjoy the musical rise and fall towards the end of the middle section  No- I think it's a nice song however it doesn't mean much to me emotionally "
157,a,"I'm already out somewhere, but this track has just taken the pace up a bit. It's going to be a good night! Like the beat Puts me in a party mood  No "
157,b,"Just going to the bar with a beautiful woman to get us some drinks  Like most of Bruno Mars Easy rhythm, cool song  No "
158,a,"It makes me smile It's one I knew I'd listen to a lot  It's catchy, makes me happy and I always end up singing a long. Yes, it's also on a playlist I made of songs to play to cheer me up."
158,b,"It's a classic. I love Michael Jackson's music It makes me want to dance. No, other than it being one I love to listen to it doesn't have any other special significance to me."
159,a,missed opportunity/personal importance/reminds me of a relationship that didn't end well./Yes. Listened to it when my ex boyfriend decided he had made a mistake finishing our relationship and wanted to try again. Then it didn't work out.

161,b,"Dance\I like the tune of the song\The music sounds good\no, I just liked the song as it has a really catchy tune"
162,a,"A song about every day heroism with a great melody It's an uplifting, melodic tune. The melody, the singer's voice, and a cool solo. I found the album by accident in a second hand CD shop. I used to go to such places a lot so it reminds of exploring music shops and occasionally finding real treasures."
162,b,"Great African-type drum rhythm It is a beautiful ballad of loss The rhythm and the piano, along with a great expression of lost love. It reminds me of a past relationship that ended and looking back on it now this song captures it."
163,a,"My appreciation for anderson .paak and the search for the right woman. I love anderson .paak, so I have both albums saved on my phone. I enjoy his style and the way that he mixes old and new techniques into his songs. I like the way it sounds and it also makes me feel hopeful and I really like the guitar solo at the end.  Yes, I have a connection with all of the songs on anderson .paak's albums because I have listened to them many times. It doesnt evoke any specific emotions, just respect for paak as an artist"
163,b,"Very poppy, and kind of all over the place with random sounds and not many lyrics. When I heard this song for the first time I thought it was very unique and it stood out to me, I saved it and continued to save other songs by the artist. I havent listened to it many times after saving it because it is a little over the top I enjoy listening to this song because its very happy and makes you feel unlike any other song. Kind of an unexpected jolt No, I have only listened to it a few times and it really doesnt mean anything to me"
164,a,"Rock 'n' Roll I saved the whole album Sometimes I do enjoy listening, sometimes I don't -  depends on my mood and the situation, as rock 'n' roll is not always what I like Not really, in a way yes, because I've been to a concert of this band, where they played it."
164,b,Love it! Saved the whole musical soundtrack on my ipod It's a great musical with great singers yes: I've seen this musical and I just love the soundtrack
165,a,"My friends that listen to the band too It's catchy, and I really like the whole album. It also makes me feel quite empowered  It makes me happier than I was prior to listening to it  Yeah, it reminds me of old friends who I've not seen for a while, so it brings back memories "
165,b,"Melancholy feelings The music is really emotive and that's something I find important in music  To me, it's really powerful, it makes me remember that I'm doing well.  Not specifically the song so much, but the whole album it comes from reminds me that I'm not the only person who is uncertain about my future "
166,a,"This track initially reminds me of the person who recommended this artist to me, and secondly brings back fond memories of eventually seeing them live with the same friend who introduced me to them. I tend to listen to a lot of new music, so the purpose of saving it is to make sure I don't forget about it. I enjoy listening to this track basically because it's catchy as hell. Yes. As mentioned above it reminds me of seeing my friend's band support this artist a few weeks after they were recommended to me."
166,b,"I don't actually remember this song at all, but i do like it. Because of the vast amount of new music I actively seek out on a daily basis I often quickly forget about some of them. Adding them to a New Music playlist means I will eventually rediscover them, as I have just done with this track. It is the exact kind of wobbly-dream-pop-guitar music I am really in to right now. No. I like the song a lot, but I have no significant memories attached to the track or artist."
167,a,"It makes me feel happy and want to dance. Reminds me of being on a night out and enjoying times with friends. It puts me in a good mood, cheers me up Because it lifts mood and reminds me of good times. No, it reminds me of good times but it is not personal to me. "
167,b,"Its quite a sad slow song.  The lyrics are very meaningful and its a song I concentrate on when I listen too.  I like the lyrics and its a slow song to listen to when you want to sit down and wind down. The lyrics mean something, you can relate to the way in which the artist felt at the time. No, I don't personally relate although I love the lyrics "
168,a,"So much better than the original. /Cos I have all the music I love, and all the music i want to listen to on my device. /The way it sweeps parts in and out, the ticking drums mixes well with the vocals. It almost builds to a peak a few times but it keeps something back to the solos at the end  /No. Its just a good song."
168,b,"Classic house piano 90s pop, but tempered with loveliness.

 I have all the tracks I own on my device. Its a great song. Its not quite cheesy pop, but it is. You almost want to put your hands in the air and it reminds me of dancing in someone's room when I was 19.  Yes. I remember seeing it on Top of the Pops, and it being something that stuck in the mind. Years later i found it again. Just scrumptious. Now I love it cos its looking back to innocent times "
169,a,"1960s Cult classic Great melody, excellent lyrics Yes, my father had it on an LP and it reminds me of him"
169,b,House music and parties Upbeat and good lyrics Lively soundtrack No 
170,a,"This song reminds me a bit of the Beatles and it has a message that says to me that you need to keep going despite uncertainty. I am an atheistic person, but I like the song it for its somewhat religious sentiment because I find that interesting despite not prescribing to that belief system. It is a beautiful song and it is calming as well as invigorating. It is part of my playlist for studying or more focused work because it is not too loud/popish. It is soulful to me, so I find it evokes a fair amount of emotions from me. No matter what situation I'm in, I will respond to this song, but the emotional response will always be a bit different.  Yes, I do. I found it when my friend recommended the band. It has helped me sort through some of my emotions, unpacking my discomfort and grief at certain parts of my life."
170,b,"Difficult and fast. I grew up playing violin and I have always wanted to play bluegrass music. The violinist in this song is incredibly talented, but this song makes me stand a bit on edge because I can imagine myself trying to keep up with the pace. I was in a bluegrass mood/phase (I'm not in that phase anymore) and I never wanted to lose this particular gem of a song.  I enjoy this song at certain times. It makes me want to play my violin more and become as good as the fiddler in the song. It makes me appreciate different sounds. 

However, I don't enjoy listening to it when I want to calm down. It is not a pump up song, but it definitely does not relax me. No, I do not. Often, I will skip over this song to get to ones I enjoy more. I do enjoy this song, but in no way do I know it well enough to hum it nor do I seek it out."
171,a,"Funk. I'm a fan of Snarky Puppy, Jazz, Funk and Fusion music in general.  The song is funky and has really interesting riffs throughout. As a drummer, I really appreciate the different rhythms. I haven't listened to this song for a while - and I love that the chords / voicings used are really great but also unpredictable. I like the fact that you can't easily anticipate what is going to happen next.  Not particularly. I'm a fan of the band and saved the album. When I shuffled my library this came up first. I do really enjoy listening to this song though. "
171,b,"Catchy Pop Discovered the album last year and really enjoyed listening to it. This is one of my favourite songs from the album.  I find the song really catchy and think that it has a great gospel feel throughout. Really like the syncopation of the rhythms too. Really enjoy listening to the track.  Again, no relationship as such but just enjoy the track. "
172,a,"Memories of when I first heard it - at University. It's a song about a dream and/or a shipwreck, and it makes me wonder what I would do in such a situation The band are one of my favourites It evokes happy memories, and is a much loved song Yes - memories and creativity are both evoked"
172,b,"I want to dance It's from a classic album (Rumours) It's fun and gets my toes tapping - if I am alone I'd 'sing' along too No - I love it, but I probably wouldn't remember it if I was asked to list my favourite 50 songs"
173,a,"It's a fun song, but has calm/chill vibes at the same time, makes me think of driving because I listened to it a lot while I drove. I liked the way it sounded, and it wasn't like the rest of my music. I felt like I was branching out a little bit. I enjoy it because it kind of calms me down and pumps me up at the same time.  I can sing to it, I don't know, it's just so versatile. Yeah, I know that I found it during my freshman year of college, because it brings back a feeling familiar to the general feeling I had of spring of freshman year."
173,b,"Sleeping, calm I saved it because I liked the way it sounded, I thought it would be a good song to fall asleep to. I enjoy listening to this song because it sounds sweet, like a cute sweet not cool sweet.  I love love love songs with acoustic guitar in them as well, and this song has soft acoustic guitar that I love!!! Yes, I found it when listening to my friend's playlist, and I associate it with certain feelings.  Like I fall asleep to this song often, and I play it a lot on rainy days because it just fits the feeling I get on rainy days so well.  "
174,a,"Reminds me of being young/I used to enjoy this song when it was in the charts, when I was much younger. I created a playlist full of songs that reminded me of my youth, and this was a big hit at the time./I quite enjoy listening to the track because I remember all the words from when I was younger, and it reminds me of my childhood / youth./No - it is just a song that was popular when I was growing up which I listen to for nostalgia"
174,b,"It makes me happy\It was a very popular song during my childhood, and I was a big fan of the Backstreet Boys\The song makes me happy. It reminds me of my childhood and how much I enjoyed the Backstreet Boys at the time. Listening to the song back as an adult, it is quite relaxing and good to chill out to.\No particular relationship. It reminds me of my primary school best friend as it was her favourite song."
175,a,"Righteousness 
Great Depression
Teamwork
Rich are overpowered
 I liked the album/soundtrack it appears on so I brought it. It also has one of my favourite artists on it. I like the message and the story behind it Yes, the track is part of a wider story and thus has an important message to say. It is also based on a film that I enjoyed."
175,b,"I love this song I had a discount for an album on the google play store and I used to buy the Wicked soundtrack for half price because it was on the first musicals I liked and it had some bonus tracks.c Yes, The musical it appears in lead to both my love of musicals."
176,a,"Recovering from a personal bereavement /I have all Mumfords & Sons Albums on my phone/I like music that speaks directly to your soul, to your raw emotions/Yes, a song I will play to remind me of how moving on with life is important, but small steps are OK"
176,b,"Being 16 and wearing a parka, drinking cider in the park\Beatles 1 album is an album for all seasons\It's easy to access\No. I would say a relationship with this sort of 60s music generally. It takes me back to the 90s when it had a resurgence off the back of Brit Pop, and those were my youth culture days"
177,a,"Excitement, beautiful harmonies, part singing. Knowing my daughter will be singing this in September.
On othe occasions it makes me cry because of the longing and hope which is portrayed. I love musical theatre, also my daughter is learning it for her show. Because it's beautiful Yes. My husband took me to see this show and then proposed so it's very special. "
177,b,"Wonder,  My daughter likes film music and wanted the soundtrack after watching the film. I love the different moods in this piece.  I'm beginning to as my daughter quotes which part of the film is being represented by the music. It will probably become one of those special memories."
178,a,"Remembering the last time I heard it at a party and what happened that night/I like the song so downloaded it/Upbeat rhythms and happy song/No, I just enjoy it and it has no real events or relationship associated with it"
178,b,"Samba and drumming\I love this song and downloaded it so I could write it for my university percussion ensemble\Really enjoy it as it is a very happy and joyful song that makes you feel positive\Yes, it reminds of when I first set up my own percussion ensemble and makes me happy as it's the first piece we played together"
179,a,Its funky/Part of an albumn that I downloaded/I like Maroon 5 and it has a good beat./No
179,b,"I smiled as soon as it came on \part of an albumn, I love Fuse ODG and afro beats \It makes me want to dance and I love dancing\I have a special relationship with any Fuse ODG music. I call it my happy music as it always makes me want to smile and cheers me up. Also went to see Fuse ODG live and it was a really good night."
180,a,"This new rap world emerging in London and being respected as a genre of music, I feel however I am still going against the crown when saying I like this song. It's a song which makes you want to dance and gets you hyped for workouts for example or sports.  It straight away makes me move and for that reason, it's worth listening to, also it makes me laugh. I do love grime it's a genre which is very honest and it very energetic. No, not really just something has always been played around be from a young age at school. Apart of the south London culture."
180,b,"Jazz funk sunny days with a smile. it has a great feeling to it with the mix of jazz and hip-hop. always makes you smile and move your head.  makes you move and makes me feel happy and if a song does that then it holds a special power which is important to me. no, again just my background of jazz and hip-hop growing up this mix is homely to me in some way."
181,a,"Boring It's part of a best of, that I bought because I like a few of the tracks. Doesn't really appeal to me.  No. 
Like I wrote, it's part of a best of-album, and so on. "
181,b,"very poppy, and kind of all over the place with random sounds and not many lyrics. When I heard this song for the first time I thought it was very unique and it stood out to me, I saved it and continued to save other songs by the artist. I havent listened "
182,a,"I really like the artist as a person because she sent me free tickets, plus I like a lot of her music I bought the album because of another track it contained.  It's funky, Motown, upbeat, and sung from the heart.  No. It's good, and I appreciate it for its quality, but it doesn't move me. "
182,b,"Ooh Florrie, I'd forgotten about this one. I bought this, and everything else Florrie had for download purely on the strength of one track I heard over the instore speakers in Coin department store, in Como, Italy. That track was ""She Always Gets What She Wants"" and I Shazammed it while waiting for my wife to choose some clothes or makeup or something.  Upbeat disco, lovely voice, don't play it often, so not overplayed.  Somewhat, because it reminds me of that holiday."
183,a,I loved this whole album as a child and now my eight-year-old daughter loves it too! So that I could easily play it through the car stereo using Bluetooth. It is uplifting and makes me think of the excitement of going to the theatre to see a live show. Yes - it's from a musical which I saw lice at the theatre as a child; my husband took me to see it again as a birthday treat a few years ago; and my daughter appeared in an abridged version with her drama group.
183,b,"Being a teenager! I loved singing along to this track in my teens (I'm now 37). I heard it again recently at a show my nephews (aged 9 and 11) were performing in and remembered how much I liked it, so I downloaded it on the way home from the show! I just love singing along and I often find I most enjoy songs that tell a story like this one. No, no particular relationship, just a fun song that I enjoy singing along with."
184,a,"That I am excited to go and see All Time Low in concert later on this year. Reminds me of a break -up. I really like the artist and the lyrics of the song.  Although it reminds me of a past relationship, it is quite a fast paced song. This helps me to overcome the negative feelings that I associate with the relationship. I also like the creativity of the lyrics. Yes - previously explained. Reminder of past relationship. "
184,b,"Inspiring to be creative and realize the light that is in the world. Reminds me of summer and if a very happy track. First seen on a YouTube video of Mongolia's got talent 2016. I find it very inspirational and it helps to boast my mood.  I really enjoy listening to this track as it makes me feel inspired. Yes - I relate it to the video and performance of the individual on Mongolia's got talent and his story and passion. This song helps to bring my mood up when I'm feeling down and I generally find it inspirational, not due to lyrics but rather tempo and beat."
185,a,"It's a track with energy, one of my favourites. /I saw Jimi play live at a festival and was mesmerised for te whole set. There are steel drums which I also like. It had a coda section at the end which makes the song much more interesting. Jim's voice is also excellent./I know it well and gives me a boost when listening. It's also a running track/Yes. It's about cutting out depression in your life and mentions his father. They are powerful references which resonate with me."
185,b,It's a joyful song. Moving and emotional\It's from a film that my wife loves. It's set in Dublin and simply shot.\I kid myself thst I could perform this if I learnt to play guitar or piano. It's raw emotion rather than a highly produced song.\Yes. As above.
186,a,"Summer. As soon as the first chord is played, it instantly makes me feel happier. I just really like the song and the beat that it has. It reminds me of summer, even though it is a new song and summer is my favourite time of year so this makes me happy. Its also a really good song to sing along to so this is also why I saved the track. It just reminds me to be happy and to enjoy life. I really like The Chainsmokers too. It also reminds me of various trips that I have had to Paris (as the title of the song is Paris), and this makes me think about my family, especially as my sister lived out there for a while. Not really, except for the fact that it reminds me of various holidays that I've had to Paris. The song wasn't released when I went on these holidays though so I don't feel as though I can say I have a relationship with the track."
186,b,"Contemporary Dance I did a dance to this so I saved it so I could practise the dance in my own time. I like Halsey and her songs. I really liked the song and I do still like it but since doing a dance to it, the only thing that I think of when listening to the song is the dance that was choreographed. Yes as I did a dance to it, so it reminds me of learning the dance and all the rehearsals that we had."
187,a,"The band and how quickly it became popular. I like the feeling and mood of the song. It is upbeat. It is energetic and happy. No, not with this track specifically. "
187,b,The sad feeling. It is a good song to sing along to. I like his voice and enjoy singing along. I identify with parts of the lyrics. No not this song but I do with other songs by this artist and so some of the relationship extends to this song. 
188,a,This was a comeback song for the Maccabees after a break./I have all of the Maccabees albums on my device./Maccabees are one of my favourite bands and this reminds me of some great gigs./Yes - Maccabees have been an important band to me so I have a relationship with a lot of their songs.
188,b,Summer days :)\I have all of the Kings of Leon albums on my device.\Kings of Leon are another of my favourite bands so I enjoy most of their songs.\Not really - it doesn't connect with me as much as other songs.
189,a,"Partying and dancing. Melody instantly stood out to me when I first heard it. Interesting structure, the 2 contrasting textures for the melody is nice, melody is catchy. Only thing I dislike is the short length. No relationship, just randomly came on when I was trying to find new music."
189,b,"The anime series 'Sword Art Online'. It was from a long time favourite singer of mine and upon hearing it for the first time I already knew how much I'd enjoy listening to it again. Relatable lyrics, interesting timbre choice for the synths, heavy bass and drums, well mixed considering the instrumentation and has a nice melody. Yes reminds me of watching the aforementioned show due to its lyrical content."
190,a,"It's really cool! Because I like listening to it and it's a track I really enjoying playing in the band I'm in as well I like the style of music, the beat and the bass line and it's a feel good song, to me Yes. It reminds me of being on stage with the band and the type of music I love to play"
190,b,"It's lovely I'm a big fan of Beth Hart and have a lot of her music saved on the device I enjoy all of her music because she is a great singer and musician but prefer her more bluesy/rock style. This song is more of a ballad. I like it but not as much as some of her other songs No, I just like to listen to it"
191,a,"My brother illegally used this song in a promo video for his videography company haha. He was not given consent by the band, nor did he ask for it. /It is a great introduction to the rest of the album that hits really heavy, but the piano and build up is a super hyped way to begin./Since it feeds directly into the opening song, on shuffle it gets you hyped and then it changes to something completely different and it never works out properly. It's like musical blueballs./No not really. It has no significance."
191,b,"My brother's drinking problem.\It's a powerful song about alcohol dependencies and it reminds me of a place I hope to never reach.\It has a sense of peacefulness about it, but at the same time, when you actually listen to the lyrics, it's quite sad.\No it's not ""my song"" or anything but it definitely has some power behind it when I listen to it."
192,a,There are better songs in this playlist that could have come up first!  I find it easy to listen to  It is easy to listen to  No
192,b,It's sad  It's calming and good to listen to when working  It's easy to listen to and has good lyrics  No
193,a,"Yay!  A nice steady, funky track with a bit of an edge./I've liked the band for a while but only have 2 favourite tracks by them./It's been a while since I've heard it and I'm not sharing listening to it with anyone else./Yes, it takes me back to a time when I was younger and more into the alternative music scene."
193,b,Apple Music has overwritten the track on my original playlist.  This is different from the original I had saved.\I enjoy 80s music and films and this ties the two together and reminds me of attempting breakdancing at school!\It was interesting to pick out the differences between this Apple Music imposed version instead of my originally saved track.\Not particularly.
194,a,"Terrible chorus/Just part of the album I downloaded, not really listened to the song much before/Verses are decent, so is the bear during the verses but the chorus is just so boring/No, usually skip it if it ever comes on"
194,b,"Future really ruined this track, but it's still so good\The Weeknd is my favourite artist and so anything he's released is saved on my phone\Good beat, great vocals\No, don't really see how you can with a song, regardless of how much I like it"
195,a,Undergrad years about 10 years ago. Starting to fall for someone for the first time./I love the album beyond (and including) its nostalgia./I enjoy listening to the details in electronic music. It provides a good contrast to what I usually listen/work on./I wouldn't say so. I have more of a relationship with the album as a whole rather than individual tracks in it as briefly hinted above.
195,b,First Masters years 3-4 years ago. How I absolutely became addicted to early 17th century music from many angles. \I love Monteverdi's madrigals. \The contrapuntal vocal lines are both baffling and beautiful. \Not really. It's much more of an aesthetic experience. No real emotional connection.
196,a,the amy winehouse film I downloaded this song after watching the amy winehouse film and remembering how much I like her music It is a song that is easy to sing along to no
196,b,revising in my room I discovered this song as when I am revising I listen to spotify discover weekly and this was a song one week and then I saved this song as I liked it and like discovering new music. Its an up beat song and it an easy song to listen to in the car no
197,a,"Dancing  Mostly only listen to gospel music so I've downloaded this album as it's a gospel album. Also the guy that made this song was a praise & worship leader in the first church that I grew up in.  I really enjoy the song because it has reggae vibe, and I love songs that have the reggae sound. It is also a very lively song which you are able to dance to.  No "
197,b,Ghana  I saved this track because I love other songs on the album that this song comes from.  The lyrics are encouraging. The artist of the song is from Ghana and my family are also from Ghana so I enjoy listening to it. Also love the beat of the track.  No 
198,a,"A throwback to being in high school. Because it motivates me to exercise, but is also just quite catchy.  I know most of the lyrics and its good to sing along to!  Yes, my brother introduced me to the music of Fort Minor. "
198,b,"The music video Because James Morrison song are one of my favourite song to sing along to. My guilty pleasure.  Again, I know the words well and can sing along.  Yes, its often sang drunkenly by my friends and I and so has good memories attached to it. "
199,a,"Teen choice awards. I chose to save this track along with other The Weeknd's latest songs so that I can listen to more of him as I enjoy his vocals and beats. The vocals, beat and his humourous lyrics are why I enjoy it. No, I listen to it rarely but just enjoy the beat and vocals, but don't feel like I relate to it."
199,b,"Pure lyrics - genius. I chose to save this track in particular because I really enjoy J Cole's lyrics. The lyrics are really powerful and he is my favourite artist because of this. Yes I feel I have a relationship with this track because the lyrics are so truthful and ""real"", and I feel as though they relate to my life and other peoples that I know of."
200,a,"""not the best song from this album"" have the album saved as I generally like the artist. lively, upbeat, pop-punk genre is quite nostalgic to me. not really with this song, moreso the artist as my friends have similar music taste so listening to this makes me think of them more than anything."
200,b,"""this is too sad for my current mood at the moment, so should probably skip it"" I do like this song as it's quite mellow and meaningful, and must have really felt in the mood to listen to it when i saved it. it's calm and acoustic sounding, and that's generally the sort of sound I go for. not really, I like the sound of the song and the lyrics but can't relate to them personally."
201,a,Dancing  It's catchy  Because it's a fun and catchy song  Yes because it reminds me of fun times with my friends 
201,b,A concert I went to  This song is by an artist I really like It has a good music beat to dance to  Yes because it reminds me of the concert I went to by this artist which brings back good memories 
202,a,"Memories of my childhood. I use to listen to this artist, and in particular this album, with my brothers. /This is one of my favorite artists. I love the way they develop melody and pace. As a synesthete the ""light show"" is pleasant and not too distracting to listen to when doing other tasks. This song also brings back good memories and the message is a good one. /The instrumentation, melodies, and use of voice are pleasant to listen to. /Yes. See previous responses"
202,b,"A mellow ""light show"". It evokes feelings of sadness and appreciation for the music at the same time as well. \I love the Eagles. It was part of the greatest hits album. Their music makes me think of my dad. More recently, their music evokes good memories having to do with my boyfriend as well. \It depends on my mood and what I am doing. Sometimes I very much enjoy it for the music, piano work, the use of voice, and the colors that come up when I listen to this track. Other times the sadness is too strong and I cannot listen to it. \I have a relationship with the artist more than the track."
203,a,going to the beach Because it is a great song Because it is relaxing and somehow it calms me No
203,b,Going back home This is the one of the few singles my favourite artist released The music is so uplifting and it reminds me of home No
204,a,"My Boyfriend/It makes me smile and puts me in a good mood when it comes on, reminds me of my boyfriend when he's away from me. /I love the words and what is being said, I imagine that it would be a great first dance at a wedding. Makes me think of happy times that lie ahead and helps me to escape the stress of third year!/Not really, just really like it as it makes me happy."
204,b,"Ed Sheeran \Its got a god beat and soo glad to have new music being released from Ed Sheeran again!\Good beat and easy to sing along to, easy listening in the car or when walking somewhere. \No, not really just like the song as its good in my opinion"
205,a,"It's on the soundtrack to the film ""Juno"". As part of the above soundtrack - it's an album I really enjoy listening to.  It's a relaxing track, quite simple and lo-fi. The music is simple - chords strummed on an instrument, and the lyrics/message is very simple and timeless. Not especially - I would generally only listen to it as part of the soundtrack it's on, unlike other songs on the same album which I would actively choose to playlist or play on their own. That said, it is instantly recognisable."
205,b,"It makes me think of Galicia, Spain and my year as an Erasmus student. It's part of a ""best of"" compilation of this band. They're a famous Gallego folk band, one of the best known. They headlined a celtic music festival I went to in Galicia last summer, so I downloaded this album to remind myself of what they sounded like. It's not really so much my thing - undoubtedly they're a very accomplished band but this track has a very fado influenced style, which I liked at one time but not so much now. I prefer their more celtic sounding stuff. 

 No, I don't knwo this one particularly. But hearing the music and the Gallego language does make me think of last summer, and of my experiences living there over ten years ago."
206,a,"Love this song. One of my favourites. Love to sing along in my car. It's a great tune and is emotive. From one of my favourite musicals No, other than it being from one of my favourite musicals."
206,b,"It makes me laugh.  Saved full album when making collection for a friend. Fun song, reminds me of watching the film. No"
207,a,"Summer and feeling chilled I liked the song when I heard it on the radio Enjoy the fact I can sing along No, I just listen to it"
207,b,Emotional I liked it It's got a proper meaning behind the words Kind of - Louis Tomlinson wrote it for his mom when she was dying of cancer and it makes me think about how my boyfriend may feel and how he may relate to it as his mom passed away from cancer under a year ago
208,a,"Andrei Tarkovsky's images. I like the band! Also, I made a list with easy-listening, downtempo songs, so I had to include this one. I like the melody of the vocals and the atmosphere the band creates in this one. I usually quote the forst lines for my girlfriend:
""You are my most special island
So famous for your flowers"""
208,b,"Jean Baudrillard's ""Saint ClÃ©ment"" (1987) photograph.  It is one of my favourite Radiohead songs. I like eveything about it. For its lyrics and the mesmerizing soundscapes. ""I'm not here, this isn't happening""
Best song for those days that you feel that you carry the weight of the world. "
209,a,Funny song from when I was young To play as a joke  It's not a serious song and not something I would choose to listen to  No
209,b,Lock Stock and 2 smoking barrels opening scene I like OCS  I particularly like Guitarist Steve Craddocks style Not really 
210,a,"It makes me remember being about 11 years old, and the friends I had then It's high energy and makes me feel happy It's a good song that leaves me full of energy (even if I might not admit to having it on there normally...) No"
210,b,"This song remind me of being around 16 It's another fun song that gives me a lift when I hear it It's a fun, upbeat song. No particular relationship, I liked the band when I was younger, but maybe prefer other songs by them"
211,a,"That it is clearly a Sheeran song and you can tell from the first note. I really liked the song and added it to the playlist I most commonly listen to I really love Ed Sheeran's style its both chill and upbeat and that appeals to me Yes I remember being shown this song in the back seat of my friend's car, I hadn't known he had released his new music and we both listened to it the first time then and really enjoyed it"
211,b,"Thinking of nights out at the SU Initially it was because I just liked the song and thought it was good for things like pre-drinks, but after going through a break up it appeals to me more It speaks to me through sharing an experience I share Yes. I went through a breakup and the lyrics really stuck to me. We broke up not because we weren't perfect for each other but because too much got in the way. He made too many mistakes for me to go back to him but I know I will never stop loving him in some way."
212,a,"Wow I'd forgotten I owned this album - it's great (in a weird 70s folk prog rock way!) I should listen to it more! An old family friend was in the band Slightly unusual music and not something I listen to regularly, so fun to explore something a bit different. Musically quite interesting, lots of interwinding parts, keeps your attention. Not this particular track, though as mentioned earlier I know a member of the band so there's a link there."
212,b,"Memories of performing the work myself  Think I bought it when learning the piece Great piece of music, but don't usually choose to listen to classical music on my laptop as the speakers don't give the richness of sound I know is in the recording. Yes, I have learnt and performed this piece in the past so feel a personal attachment to it. This particular recording also has a link as Susan Milan was my flute teacher and I know Ian Brown through various musical avenues. "
213,a,Dancing and parties  Because I like the song it's a feel good song  Feel good song  Yes I do I play it when I'm happy 
213,b,An old friend  Because it reminds me of somebody I loved  Because it reminds me of somebody I loved  Yes I play it when I want to be reminded of the person 
214,a,"Going to the gym as this is usually the song I listen to when I'm on the stationary bike due to the music video for this track. Enjoy listening to it on a regular basis and fits in with the rest of my playlist Easy to listen to, catchy and good song to sing along with No real relationship other than I think it's catchy and gets me motivated"
214,b,"The parodies of the music video. Also usually the song I listen to when I am getting ready to go on a night out with my friends. Catchy and fun to sing along to enjoy listening to it occasionally but not one I could listen to over and over again due to it being repetitive  No relationship with the track, just nice to listen to every now and again."
215,a,"I actually haven't heard this song before properly. But it's uplifting, bouncy and melodic.  Amazon Music often recommends new albums to download based of ones that you already have. So I think this album must have been from one of those times, as I haven't really listened to it much before.  It is quite similar to other music that I listen to and it has a nice feeling to it.  No. I don't think I have heard it before. "
215,b,"It's a fun, silly song. Much like a lot of Adam Green's music.  I only just discovered Adam Green a couple of weeks ago, but found that I could download all of his albums for free on Amazon Music so did that.  It's a fun, silly, happy, short song. Not really. I listen to this album when I'm working sometimes though. "
216,a,"it's a nice little tune with strange sounds, high production quality wanted to listen again It's euphoric and the sounds chosen by the artists fit my tastes no - it has nothing to with me"
216,b,"The quintessential vaporwave anthem I was playing it over and over, so I liked it to reach it again. It's spaced out, really unique and the sounds are really nice.  No - this is something I listen to as an observer I have not known about the track for that long."
217,a,"Latin America I love Santana It brings memories back Yes, every song in my device means something specific. "
217,b,"Love Because it reminds me of a special person Memories of a special person Yes, me and my partner use to listen to this song while we were planning something very special."
218,a,"Feels like a good song to start my work on a very sunny day (This song is not much ideal on a rainy or gloomy day because beat does not move along with the weather). Then i feel everything goes smooth as long as the song is played.

220,a,"Summer time between my first and second year at uni spent in my rural home town with my highschool friends.

221,a,"A slightly slow rendition/I'm learning this piece for grade 7 piano and wanted to listen to a few versions for comparison./I always love Handel. This version is not bad - accurate and nice ornamentation, but could be a little more lively./No - I've only listened to it a couple of times."
221,b,"I used to listen to this all the time.\I love this track - reminds me of my first time at university.\It's pretty catchy, I like the lead singers voice (she does an amazing death growl) and I have fond memories of listening to it.\Yes - I had it on a mix tape which came with me everywhere."

222,b,"Justin Bieber\Was on my weekly discover playlist and enjoyed it\Can party to it but also listen to at work, multifunctional  \No,"
223,a,"It's different from a lot of the other chilled tracks in the album. It's guttural with a bass you can feel. You can't help but move/nod your head to it It was part of an album I'd heard tracks from and enjoyed them. It was recomme fwd by someone whose opinion I trust It's out of the ordinary, you don't hear things like that every day Yes - it reminds me of the person who first recommended it to me"
223,b,The fact I can play it on ukulele and sang it in a silly work talent show (and won).  It's a quality song from a band who were great at the time  (haven't saved anything after The Bends album) I know I can sing it quite well so I feel confident when I hear it Yes - it's my winning track I pull out of the bag if I ever have to 'do a turn'
224,a,"Powerful, inspiring  It's from the soundtrack of a tv show I like  Reminds of the tv show, makes me feel good/motivating  Yes, I watch the tv show with my best friend from back home, we never watch an episode apart even if we have to Skype and sinc the show up, so it makes me think of her and how much I love her "
224,b,"Good song to show of your rap skills to/sing with your friends  Think when it came out I was slightly obsessed  It's sort of a classic now that the majority of people know, sort of nostalgic to listen to  No, nothing emotional, it's just a good track to listen to "
225,a,"Dance, Good mood I love Donald Byrd music. Also, this track cheers me up. Makes me feel happy and positive.  Not really. "
225,b,"Oh, this song. I haven't listened to it for a while. it's part of my favourite Bonobo's albums. It's a great track for background music. It's not my favorite which I'd play over and over again.  Also, it's good for working as it's instrumental. Yes and no. Yes because it makes me focus and reminds me of positive times. No - it doesn't bring any clear memory of a specific moment with this track. "
226,a,"Can't make up my mind if it makes me happy or sad. Because I love Holliday's voice, and the way she puts such emotion into her songs. Love the tune, love her voice, love the arrangement. Not particularly, it evokes no specific memories. I just like it."
226,b,"Don't know if I've heard this before! Bought all on Benson's albums within short space of time, and put them all on my iPod to listen later. Benson's voice is soothing, and it has interesting chord progressions. No. Not actively listened to it before."
227,a,"Unusual for the artist and musical genre that he normally sings in (Country). The unexpected experience and personal curiosity. Time of year (it's almost summer, it's a long weekend here and weather is supposed to be mild (later than usual this year), unusual treatment of song, favorite song among jazz standards. Yes.  Have listened to it often, enjoy the melody, often play on piano."
227,b,"Fun, and sexy! Love this saucy song, especially the silliness of the words. Fun arrangement, silliness of the words, artist is a favorite of mine. One of the first jazz artists that I identified with, and purchased multiple albums from."
228,a,Phenomenal song played by the greatest guitarist of all time.  It also reminds me of Goodfellas because this song is in the movie.   I am a massive Eric Clapton fan and I believe his work with Cream is some of his best.   It has great lyrics and an awesome guitar riff. Yes it reminds me of Italian mob movies as well as music from the 60's.  
228,b,Tom Petty and his Super Bowl performance.   I love Tom Petty and his work with the Heartbreakers.  I believe Tom Petty has one of the most unique voices in all of music.   No I just enjoy listening to it. 
229,a,It was very relaxing and had an upbeat tempo. I have listened to it a lot so it was getting old after awhile.  It lightens the mood and is a good sing along song.  I like I because it is different then most of his songs but also has a different tune then most pop music today.  No. 
229,b,"Seeing him live at Outside Lands!  It's a catchy song and it's just fun to listen to!  It's a feel good song and it vibes.  Yes, it reminds me of summer the the music festival. "
230,a,"Old fashioned piano solo/Part of an album that interests me. /Pleasant, off-the-peg British library music of the 50s - a favourite style of mine. /Yes - as a leading figure in the knowledge of the genre I am often asked information about this kind of music, so it's essentially research material, but I like to listen to it anyway."
230,b,"Romantic strings - again 50s music. \Part of an album I bought. \Similar reason - a style and era of music I like and find relaxing and not too challenging. \Light music of the 50s is a specialist subject of mine, so it's a part of research alongside a style I like to listen to and perform."
231,a,"Upbeat, fun/I like it/It's upbeat and good background music to just put on shuffle while I'm busy or working /I guess. I came across it a couple months ago and really liked it and actually named a playlist after it because it set the tone for the rest of the songs on the playlist."
231,b,"It's a fun song but I don't know it well\I heard it on a different playlist a while ago and it fit the feel of the playlist so I added it. \It's a fun song to listen to \Not really. I haven't listened to this song a whole lot, it's just on the playlist"
232,a,"Dancing I love the energy of the song and it helps me walk faster than usual It's sung by one of my favourite drag queens, the vocals are great and it makes me feel energetic No, i just discovered it in one of Adore's albums and I liked it"
232,b,"Gipsy I love the vocals and the feeling it gives me Because it's a modern day rock cover of an old gipsy song. It makes me feel like dancing and it makes my heart beat faster No, I just found it on YouTube by accident"
233,a,The melancholic beauty of its sound and lyrics./Troye Sivan released 3 of the music videos from his first album as a trilogy where each followed on from the other and I downloaded Talk Me Down after having listened to Wild and Fools as I thought I'd be sure to enjoy the final song in the trilogy if I loved the first two so much and it turned out to be the best in the trilogy. I got the album for Christmas and Talk Me Down is still my favourite song of his./A lot of the music I listen to is more upbeat but I enjoy slower songs like this too and even consider it to be my favourite single of 2016. The song does a great job of transporting you into its story as Troye soulfully sings the song's simple yet effective lyrics complimented by some excellent production which is paced very well feeling subtle at times and then more dramatic as the song goes on. /It's not a song that I relate to personally but I have listened to it many times due to how much I love it and I did think of its brillia
233,b,The message of this song which has helped me become more comfortable with my sexuality.\Because its a great song and a song that I can help pick me up at times when I'm feeling down especially if its due to someone's homophobia or if I'm worrying about what others might think of my sexuality.\Its an upbeat encouraging song aimed at gay people but the lyrics aren't too specific so some people could relate to it for other reasons. I really like its lyrics and too and Joey does have a good voice.\I first listened to this track when I was on the bus back home from town after someone had been homophobic towards me. I wanted to listen to some music to cheer me up and had heard about this song so I decided to give it a listen. I really enjoyed listening to it and its lyrics and music video made me feel better and the song has helped me to feel more comfortable about my sexuality and it has helped me feel more confident about being open about who I am. I selected 'enjoy' rather than 'really en
234,a,"Former jazz singing lessons from 5 years ago plus the people I knew then.  On an album by an artist I like Laid back rhythms, great vocal, interesting message  Not as such, only as a song. "
234,b,"How sad it is that the artist died so young.  Loved one particular track so bought the album. This was on the album.  So bittersweet not just because of her death but the message of the song.  Not as such, only as a track I'm happy to listen to. "
235,a,"Joy, celebration that Jesus Christ is victorious over death I listen to a lot of Christian Music and this is one of my favourite tracks, especially if I want to sing it as a worship song . It is upbeat and joyous, which is the kind of music I really enjoy Yes. It is from one of my favourite albums. I also introduced it to a friend who really loved it so I think of her when I listen to it"
235,b,"Excitement Again it is an upbeat song about a relationship with God, which is the kind of song I would choose to listen to It is upbeat, about God and challenges me to see what my priorities are No. While I really enjoy it, it doesn't really remind me of any personal connections"

236,b,"carefree person story, musical backing Tells a story. I can sing along to yes  knew it years ago and recently found this new recording"
237,a,"Period abroad at university with the impending end of my relationship with a boy from America I really like the song and it gives me bittersweet nostalgia about a significant period of my life. Nostalgia that lets me reflect on the choices I have made and how I have grown as a person I really love the lyrics Yes. It was a meaningful song and I really connected with the lyrics several years ago when I was going through the imminent end of my relationship. The song is based on the book by John Green about two young people with cancer and the eventual death of one of the protagonists. The song covers how ""pain demands to be felt"" and how everything that was once meaningful will stop as if it never mattered. I really connected to the bargaining aspect of the grieving process (about how I will ""be better if you stay""). As I knew that once my boyfriend and I left the country that we would never see each other again. Almost like a bereavement. It allowed me to connect to and express my emotio"
237,b,"Summer nights as a teenager smoking weed in a park I love the band The Cat Empire so I have all their albums on my device It's easy and chilled listening No. I just like the song. Sometimes it makes me think about what the song might be about. One of the lead singers is Jewish, and the song is about not being afraid and standing up for other people. It sometimes makes me wonder what I would do in such a situation. But the thought is fleeting if it occurs at all."
238,a,"The lyrics, i love the first lines as they are so descriptive ""you're falling apart from the inside out""/It's one I like to use under different conditions - driving, housework, gym/The track makes me feel good, the music is almost defiant and makes me feel empowered./Not really"
238,b,"Sexy,  sultry, seductive but again empowering.\One I enjoy driving to.  I usually sing along as well. \I like to sing along and I love some of the lyrics as they portray an almost desperate yearning.\No.  I like the track and remember it from being younger too but it doesn't have a special meaning."

240,a,It's got a wonderfully syncopated bass line... /It was a song from a list I made to remember my Dad. He used to play loads of Beatles songs. when I was younger. /I enjoy the track because it is a fun upbeat number. It is not my favourite from the playlist but I definitely enjoyed listening to it. The bass line groove is the best thing about it for me. /As mentioned I created the playlist in memory of my Dad who passed away in 2016. This song in particular is not of big significance but it was certainly one he played to me when I was a young boy as it is off the Rubber Soul album one of his favourites.
240,b,"A wave of nostalgia about times with my Dad over my lifetime. \Running On Faith is part of the unplugged album from Eric Clapton that I love very much - I added it to the playlist in memory of my Dad in 2016.  \I love this song, in particular, the slide guitar and emotive lyrics. The song is very poignant for me and my family after my Dad passed away and though the raw emotion the song triggers is a little hard it is a welcome one. I think this album has really helped me process the loss. \Yes I do it is a wonderful song that resonates very deeply with me. The acoustic guitars are very well played - a beautiful song all round and very special for me."
241,a,"Old movies and winter I like listening to this style of music when I am traveling between work and home. It's easy listening No, I came across it once on a Jazz album"
241,b,"Musicals, going to the theatre I like watching/listening to musicals I enjoy doing musical theatre and the energy from the songs i've never seen this musical or performed it. Just came across it on youtube once."
242,a,I like to run to this song I liked the cool piano riff I enjoy it because it's upbeat and has cool instrumentals  No. I just like to run to it.
242,b,"Listening to this album on the train. I like the ukulele. I like they lyrics and the ukulele. No. I like the song, but I don't have any great memories associated with listening to it."
243,a,"I love this song/I love acoustic versions of songs and I love the singers voice and the piano melody. /I've just discovered this song, so it's still relatively new for me. I enjoy the lyrics. /No, I just like the way it sounds."
243,b,"My school trip to Rome. \It became really popular some years ago, and eventually it was always stuck in my head so I decided to save the track. \It's a fun song and it puts me in a good mood. \Yes, when I went on a school trip to Rome we listened to the song non-stop and it became our ""Rome Song"". So all the time I hear the song, I think of the amazing trip to Rome."
244,a,"High school/Long time fan of Bryan Adams - one of my favourite songs/Always been a fan of Bryan Adams, grew up listening to his songs, don't think there's many of his songs that I don't like. Its catchy and just the right tempo./This particular track reminds me of high school which is when I first heard the song. I was around 13 years old. Bryan Adams had recently come to Pakistan to perform a concert (the first ever Western artist to do so) and we were all a bit giddy from the experience."
244,b,"Nothing really\It's one of John Mayers most recent releases and he hasn't released any new music in a while. Was intrigued. \Catchy chorus \No. I've only recently heard it (approx 1-2 months ago), not a huge fan, haven't really formed any opinion/relationship with it."
245,a,"The sheer complexity and beauty of the music and how easy the choir make it sound.  I am currently learning the piece and have fallen in love with it (and the whole album it's from).  Westminster Cathedral Choir were second to none under Mr O'Donnell and their interpretation, balance etc makes this a really outstanding performance.  Yes. I'm currently learning the piece. As a singer, and one who sings in church choirs, it's important to connect and really believe what you're singing. No one wants to stand there like anpudding just pushing the sound back out there with no real understanding. "
245,b,"Just how amazing the soloist at the beginning of the track is! We saw Matilda in the West End, it's a cracking show. My son asked if we could download the soundtrack, so we did! The energy of the performance, Tim Minchins Music, its great!  Yes. When it comes on, much to my children's embarrassment, I will sing along...loudly! "
246,a,Seeing Muse perform it live I love Muse.  It is just a great rock track and it makes me think of happy times going to concerts with my wife and sons.  Yes because i live to sing aling with it when I'm on my own. 
246,b,"It reminds me of holidays on the beach.  It's from the Sunset Ibiza album which I have in my iPod as I like most of the tracks in this album.  I find it relaxing, it has a good beat and it reminds me of beach holidays.  Yes. Because I like the lyrics and the miod of the track fires my imagination. "
247,a,It reminds me of a festival in summer where I saw it live Because it was a new album and I like James Blake's music It just sounds unique and I like his voice I saw James Blake live so it reminds me of that 
247,b,It sounds cool  Because it sounds cool It reminds me of someone  See above
248,a,As this is a Bhangra track (a type of music that originates from the Punjab region of India) the first thing that comes to mind is Punjabi weddings and parties.  I genuinely love Punjabi/bhangra music and it's the genre I listen to the most.  I'm Punjabi myself so this type of music is a big part of my culture.  Yes. I'm proud to be Punjabi and intact with my Punjabi roots. 
248,b,"Again, this reminds me of wedding season as it's also a Punjabi/Bhangra track. However, this one also reminds me of university and my friends as I remember asking them if they had heard this yet.  Same reasons as before. Also, I just love listening to this type of music as it's usually very upbeat and reminds me of good times I've had with family and friends.  Same reasons as before.  Yes. Same reasons as before. "
249,a,"Acoustics, Guitar, Love, Happiness, 
Home Liked the artist and other songs on the album Very catchy and sounds nice, sounds happy  No"
249,b,"Life, growing up, university school and education, establishmentism or the system  Catchy  Catchy, gets in your head  No"
250,a,"Good house party track, summer beach party /Like the music and drop in the songs. Reminds me of summer holidays beach club parties/Reminds me of fun crowd, sun and fun/No really although it does remind me of summer holidays"
250,b,"Clubbing in London, party with friends and a good Lightshow \Like the tune.. reminds me of a fun night  out\Reminds me of time off, having fun with friends \Not directly but reminds me of time off"
251,a,"It reminds me of being a teenager and continuously flicking through all of the music channels on TV to find the video for this song./Because I love the song - a guilty pleasure - and it brings back good memories for me./It's a happy song for me. I know all of the lyrics./Yes - it reminds me of being a teenager, of listening to it on repeat, of summer days going to a music festival which Blue headlined and brought much excitement to an otherwise sleepy part of Devon."
251,b,It's another song from my teenage years!\It brings back good memories for me - I would have added it to my 90s girl groups playlist.\It's not my favourite song - almost a filler for a longer playlist.\Not really - it's just a song I recognise from being younger.
252,a,"That the song is catchy and upbeat.  I like Little Mix and I enjoy pop music.  I enjoy listening to the track because it is relatable and upbeat.  Yes, I would associate it with past experiences. "
252,b,"That it was one of my favourite songs when it was released. I saved this track as I still enjoy listening to it, it still appeals to me.  I enjoy listening to this track as it is catchy, reminds me of times around its release.  Yes, it surrounds unrequited love, you can imagine something between yourself and another person but don't know how they feel. I relate to that idea. "
253,a,"feel happy
feel upbeat i enjoy the song i enjoy it no, i do not connect with any of the lyrics "
253,b,to sing along! its a song that makes you join in and sing its different from other music that is out at the minute yes it makes you think of your past also
254,a,Nights out at KRAP. I liked the song and the band is one of my favourites. It's just really good. No
254,b,"Download festival 2016 It is a good song and will always provide memories. I don't really know, I just really like the song. Yes in a sense due to seeing it live and having that experience."
255,a,It is a lovely love story song that brings out my emotions. It was a song that Mum and I used to listen to when I was very little. Now it reminds me of my boyfriend as it was one of the first songs we found out that we both like.  The lyrics mean things to me. 
255,b,I got soul but Im not a soldier' shows that anyone can be kind honest and brave regardless of their background. It is my step mum's favorite song.  It is a song that my 8 year old brother sings in the car with me and my 11 year old sister and they have been singing it for over 4 years As above
256,a,"That I am glad it's this song and not some random crap that's buried in my iTunes library. I love the sound of Com Truise, especially all the material he released in 2011. This song is from that period. I was a big Boards Of Canada fan and before that, a huge Aphex Twin fan.  I love that downtempo IDM sound that Com Truise puts his own spin on. I find his music aesthetically pleasing for any type of mood I'm in. I listened to a lot of Com Truise in 2011. All those songs from those few releases that year remind me of that year in a nostalgic way, but it's also music I know I will enjoy forever."
256,b,"HA! Such a contrast from Com Truise. Takes me WAY back. ""...And Justice For All"" will always be my favorite Metallica record. I miss this era of Metallica, when they didn't care about what people thought, they just created whatever they wanted.  It was the last time they were ever looked at as musical innovators. This song is a good example of that. Not this particular track, but this is the record that turned me into metal, which I am still an avid fan of. I remember hearing ""One"" around the time it came out (I was 10 years old) and thinking that it was the greatest music I've ever heard. Still waiting for them to release a much needed remastered version of the record."
257,a,Love that opening riff Bought the album Love the riff & feel of the song Yes it was one of the first tracks that got me into ZZ Top
257,b,Not heard this for a while  Bought the album  Love the song  Yes. Takes me back to the  time it was released 
258,a,Emo I like it. It gets me in touch with my feels Yes
258,b,Drugs Its trippy Gets me pumped Yes
259,a,"This song reminds me of the summer time and playing music really loud in the summer holidays /Because I really love the song, it makes me feel really good and upbeat./It's a feel good song, always makes me feel happy./I'm not sure"
259,b,"It brings back memories of seeing The Lion King at the theatre \I really enjoyed the theatre production and wanted to be able to listen to the music whenever I wanted to.\I really enjoy it as it brings back some really good memories of a wonderful evening with a close friend. The music is beautiful too\Yes, it takes me back to a very special evening"
260,a,"First year at university. Ed Sheeran is one of my favourite artists. I enjoy listening to this song as it brings back memories. Yes, I listened to it a lot when I was going through a break up in my first year of university. "
260,b," Car journeys. I heard it on the radio and liked it. I enjoyed listening to it as it's a catchy, up-beat song.
 No, I just like listening to it. "
261,a,An oldie but a goodie All of my music is on my device. It's a band whose music I like and the song is quite upbeat and catchy. No. It's not one I would pick out to listen to if I was asked to choose a song by this artist.
261,b,"Nothing in particular All my music is on my device I liked fast, rocky numbers. No. This album was bought for me and, whilst I do like it, I haven't listened to it enough to say I have a relationship with any song from it."
262,a,Gimell pairing of top treble parts Went to the 2014 concert & got hooked on the music Love the tonality & structure. Recording / performance is also badically flawless Yes. Escaping awful job in France to go to Peterborough cathedral & hear this..
262,b,"Joyful bouncing between the two choirs Love Herreweghe's Bach Superb music, superbly performed Was one of the first Bach pieces I knew"
263,a,The lyrics and the crescendo close to the end of the song  Because I listen to it over and over again  I love singing along  No
263,b,The rap verses  I like rap  I'd like to learn the lyrics  No
264,a,"ha! love it! Its a fun song! I love listening to it.  Its a good song to dance and sing to. 

Its also really well known, so good for parties etc.  Not really, except that I love it! "
264,b,"oh I like this song.  Like Wake Me Up, its another song I will listen to without getting bored. 

Often I will skip between tracks, but this playlist is full of songs I love to listen to.  I like that its pretty chilled out, but then also ramps up a bit in the chorus. I find the words interesting. I like the general sound world of the Stereophonics.  This is the sort of thing I would listen to as a teenager, so I guess in that sense I do. It reminds me of teenage me, as if I were an old friend. "
265,a,"The second song I ever heard by this group, who are now my favourite group. It's enjoyable to listen to and it also reminds me a bit of the summer 2013. It's upbeat and fun to sing along with the parts that I know It's a track that makes me feel happy whenever I hear it because of it's link with when I first started listening to Kpop and BTS as a group"
265,b,"It's chorus is catchy It's a song that I enjoy listening to, and I generally appreciate it when it comes on shuffle The singers are good and the beat is fun to listen to. I wouldn't be super upset if I couldn't listen to it ever again but it's nice to have when it comes on in shuffle."
266,a,"Road trips in my first car singing at the top of my lungs It was a song that gave me good feelings & brought me back to a place where I had less responsibility & more freedom. Good tempo, lifts my spirits through the music, I use it while I exercise also.  Yes & no. It's not tied to any specific event or experience but connects me to a time & somewhat place"
266,b,Summers working It's a song I can sing aloud to I can sing my heart out to this song whether while running or driving in the car or cleaning around the house.  No. Not a specific relationship. I love the band & the majority of their songs
267,a,A sense of calmness and serenity. Because it puts my life into perspective when  I feel anxious or worried about something. Because it calms me down and makes me think of only positive things all negative things just fall away. Yes- It's a christian track so when I play it it makes me think of God and his promises so it gives me a perspective and reminder that I am loved.
267,b,I think love and relationships. Because it makes me happy and hopeful for the future. Because it refers to struggles in life and reminds me of the fact that we all have them. No
268,a,"It feels calm, relaxed (but I remember the video well, which I enjoyed) for now but I am awaiting the build up / for the tune to kick-in properly... Absolutely love this track & any similar EDM, clubbing style music... Although I listen to an extremely diverse mix of music from all era's & genre's. ... At the time of release, this track & band were quite different to other music out there & instantly liked it.
Also, it is guaranteed to lift my mood & help to give me the 'friday feeling' / wanting to go out, put more music on & have fun!
Also I like the break in the song (approx 2min 30) where it introduces rap & then smashes back into the main song with a fuller, busier backing track! No"
268,b,"School Bell = Britney Spears (Oh Baby baby) but when the repetitive riff begins & the clapping, it begins to feel more like 'I love Rock & Roll' but this band are at the opposite end of the scale to Britney in terms of genre, so I am expecting a more 'angry riff' to kick-in (around 1min 30) I listen to a wide variety of music (& used to be a big supporter of Sum41, Linkin Park, Greenday but never really found any female rock music I enjoyed until this).
 I like the rawness of the lead singers voice & some of the lyrical content (''I've seen better days....'' & especially the irony in this part: ''Oh Lord, Heaven Knows we belong way down below'') No"
269,a,Training at EE Like the song Makes me think of the video which I love Memories 
269,b,The cover of the LP\Like the song and the artist\Makes me smile\Childhood memories
270,a,"Its my Gym playlist, gets me feeling energetic For my gym playlist As its upbeat.  No not really , good for the gym that's about it."
270,b,"Dancing, clubbing and djing. Its an energetic and good for the gym. Reminds me of my friend djing and good for the gym  Yes, Reminds me of my friends djing and makes me feel happy"
271,a,"catchy music and reminds me of summer  it's a good song? Good song and i like the artist No - just one in his whole album i enjoy, nothing too special about this song"
271,b,"""Oh this is a random one"" Heard it on the tv and wanted to remember the name so added it to my playlist  It's got a good tune and decent enough lyrics, easy to listen to  No - just a random song i heard and liked"
272,a,"Haha, that this is a track from one of the most expensive records I ever bought... I have this song on a 5x record box set which cost $130 a few years ago. I love this band, they only ever released weird bootleg live albums, without ever making a 'proper' album. This is my favourite song of theirs, and I have at least ten versions of it- they're all full of distortion and noise, often with bad sound quality and people talking, feedback, shambolic performances etc but it all adds to the strange chaotic wildness of the band. Even though it's slow track, the lo-fi way that it's recorded and the sort of unpredictable character of all of this band's recordings mean that its kind of exciting, it feels as if the wheels might fall off and it collapse, or it might manage to wobble along into something amazing. Because I have a bunch of different versions of this track by the same band, it means I'm not completely certain what will happen next. It's interesting, I feel like I have a relationship"
272,b,"It's really really long! (more than 1 hour) The artist is great, the guitarist of a band I love. I've seen the band many times and his solo performances several times too, and they're always interesting, so I downloaded a bunch of his albums.  I can't remember specifically selecting this track to listen to, but have probably listened to it on a long playlist of just this artist- long ambient guitar improvisations that are quite relaxing and spaced out. I feel like I don't have a relationship with this track in particular, but i do with the artist and with this kind of music more broadly- I've been listening to this guitarist for years and years and feel like I could recognize his style anywhere, which adds to the 'relationship'. This track is good but I wouldn't say I've built a relationship with this track, just because I haven't listened to it often enough for it to be recognisable."
273,a,"Ploddy dirgey thing, why is this on this playlist?/I actually quite like it, but am not in the mood for it right now./Depends on my mood, so wasn't sure what to put. It's on my 'Faves' playlist, which has been compiled over years and years and has a lot on it, some of which I'm a bit bored with and ought to remove. But this is relatively recent. I think it was on Weekly Discoveries playlist, which I normally listen to at least some of each week, and save the things that I really like. I think this would have been the harmonic progression in the chorus, and the layers of guitar. I'd probably use it in the gym for weights, as it's quite slow and that makes for better technique./No. I don't have any particular associations for it."
273,b,"Ooh, what's this? I haven't listened to this for a while.\I honestly can't remember. It might be another Discover Weekly, and I sometimes mooch around the suggestions on Spotify, or 'similar artists' links. I like the way the arrangement builds, and the 'big' sound.\**It's more upbeat than the last one, and less dirgey, more uplifting, particularly the rising harmonic progression in the middle 8, so more suited the mood I'm in which is positive right now.\No. No particular associations with anything, just something I heard and liked."
274,a,"Church and worship  It's a song that I love and I enjoy listening to worship music in my car, it helps me feel really peaceful especially since I get anxiety when driving. It has a soothing melody with no dramatic parts. It also has really beautiful lyrics. Yes, It was a song that at one point I listened to on repeat and the lyrics are something that I want to believe myself."
274,b,I haven't listened to this particular song in a really long time I loved their previous album and I like their church Builds nicely and is again a really soothing track with wonderful lyrics. No
275,a,"Takes me back a few years! At the time I really liked it. I enjoy the song, it is quite cheery and reminds me of an earlier stage in my life. No. it was a track I liked and that was it."
275,b,"I always compare it to the Dire Straits version. I was using this track with a group of students that I was teaching. The students had severe learning difficulties and we were reading Romeo and Juliet. We acted it out and made a PowerPoint with the photos. I used the track for that. I live the song and the memories it provokes. Yes, it was a key point in my career. I time I was really happy and it reminds me of that."
276,a,"ooh i like this song/up beat and fun to listen too/nice beat and happy vibes/no, i just like it"
276,b,"ooh yeah i really love this song'\it's my favourite song\fun, easy to dance too, good lyrics, nice beat\no, just my favourite song"
277,a,"nice piece of South American dance music Must have bought it recently, I refresh my play list frequently nice beat, jolly tune not sure what you mean with this question so I'm going to say no"
277,b,nice glitchy piece of modern electronica recently purchased the album I like electronica no not sure what you want from such a bizarre question
278,a,"It's an old fashioned track. Instrumental which I don't normally enjoy.  I saved it accidentally as another of the artists tracks has a guest vocal by Raul Malo a singer I like. I now realise it is the vocal I like rather than the instrumentals  I prefer vocal tracks for active listening, only like instrumentals when studying or sleeping  No it was saved accidentally and I would normally skip if it comes on "
278,b,The musical Forever Plaid. I saved this track because Johnny Mathis is collaborating with the cast of Forever Plaid a musical I like  I like the Forever Plaid soundtrack very much and this is like a bonus track for that musical.  I used to listen to it while waiting outside my wife's acting class while waiting to take her home. So it brings back warm memories 
279,a,Beating breast cancer i find it relaxing and inspiring to me. It makes me feel good and reminds me I can get through anything.  Yes.  I saw ruby sing it at a jools holland concert after I had finished all my cancer treatment.  It was very emotional for me and I felt like I was finally able to start living my life again.
279,b,"A summers day at portsmouth harbour, drinking cider after cycling down the seafront with my partner. Good happy memories, relaxing song,  Reminds me of a lovely, relaxing day.  The words of the song sum up the day perfectly for me.  No"
280,a,"The TV show House MD Because it is relaxing and a good remix of the original song I know the words so can sing along No, I just like the song"
280,b,"My mum It's a song my mum really likes and I like it too The fact that it reminds me of my mum, and I know the words. Yes, my mum really likes it and will sing along to it if it's on, when she doesn't usually sing along to songs."
281,a,Strutting down the street/Because I enjoy listening to it when I am walking./It has a good beat and is reasonably uplifting and dancy./Not really- music is music to me and is just a matter of listening to it as opposed to having a relationship with it.
281,b,Being confident and strong within yourself\Because it's good fun to listen to and dance to\Because it's an exciting track with a lot of fun to it.\Kind of- it's a song I've listened to and liked for several years and I suppose it has some memories attached to it
282,a,"Blast out 
Sing along 
Loud  Up lifts my mood, or helps me shake out anger.  Helps me shake out anger, release anxieties.  No "
282,b,"Sing along, mood uplift, happy  Reminds me of good times, everybody knows this song. Love singing along to it. Up lifts my mood.  Anxiety release and uplifts my mood when I sing along to this song.  Yes, reminds me of good times with all my friends at parties singing along to his song. "
283,a,I like it ..it reminds me of something else  I was given the cd as a gift  Good sound ..pleasing melody ..stirring tempo Not so much ..haven't listened to it enough 
283,b,Remember seeing them at a gig  Bought at a gig and wanted to remember it  Brings back good memories..I like to play this kind off music myself on guitar  Yes ..I was seeing another artist and this band were supporting ..I loved their sentiment Theo humour and their humanity 
284,a,"Happiness. Youth. It's a fabulous song, and reminds me of being a teenager and summertime.  It's uplifting and immediately makes me feel happy. It's got a great melody and I love to sing it really loud. No - it's just always been a song I've enjoyed listening too"
284,b,"Happy as I like Taylor Swift, but secretly wished it was one of my more favourite of her songs! As part of downloaded album. It builds up to be quite a catchy song that you can songbird along too No, when I listen to it I'm reminded that it's quite a catchy tune, but I probably wouldn't have chosen to download it as a single if it hadn't been on the album "
285,a,I never know what the lyrics are I enjoy the artist and bought the album It's got a good rhythm and is produced really well. I don't have a particularly strong relationship with the track. I like other songs by the same artist better.
285,b,I don't remember owning this track. I bought/was given the album because I enjoy the artist. It's a fun pop song. I like Feist's voice. I had forgotten I owned this track but it reminds me of my late teenage years.
286,a,Disney Fun to listen to Easy listen no - just like it
286,b,sofia vergara Catchy song Fun song no - just like it
287,a,"Oh love this one! It holds strong memories of growing up in the early pop music era.  It reminds me of the first time I got interested in pop music, I was quite around 11 at the time, the song was quite 'daring' to me at that age!  My older brother used to play the small 45rpm record. Pure nostalgia.  Yes - absolutely. It brings to mind years gone by, family, childhood, innocence yet on the cusp of starting to understand the world from a more young adult perspective. "
287,b,"Great Track! Because I like the band who sing it and I love the song!  I like the simplicity of the tune and words, the good rhythm,  I can 'sing' or even dance or clap along to it if I so choose to do! ** I have a relationship with this particular track as it is gospel music. I was brought up in a born again Christian home. Although I don't particularly follow any particular religious beliefs myself now in my adult life,  those formative years of sitting in pews singing hymns and gospel songs have never really left me. ( that will please my parents if they are looking down from heaven at this particular moment in time !!! )"
288,a,"Celebration
This is a very fast version which helps to create a bit of tension It is part of a compilation CD which I was given as a gift
I have previously performed this piece (as an orchestral leader and alto singer) The orchestra part is very interesting and challenging to play - I feel a sense of accomplishment knowing that I have played it myself before.
Music from the Baroque era is my favourite to listen to and play Yes - I have performed it on a number of occasions (Violin I and Alto)"
288,b,"The music is very calming and I have to listen carefully to appreciate the meaning of the lyrics
It has a slight soporific feeling  I have been to see the musical which it is from (Phantom of the Opera) and so bought the soundtrack The orchestral parts are interesting and help to add to the emotional impact that the piece intends to create
I really like the lead singer's use of falsetto register No"
289,a,Still relevant today One of my songs It reminds me of my youth. Yes. Public Enemy was the first gig I was allowed to go to on my own with friends. 
289,b,"My dad I love it and reminds me of my childhood.  It's a classic track Yes, it reminds me of my dad and his Northern Soul obsession. "
290,a,How amazing it was to hear it sang live last year Love Eric Church Reminds me of the times I have been lucky enough to have seen him perform live Yes. Reminds me of a fantastic series of concerts topped off with Eric closing and headlining.
290,b,Their 2011 gig It's one of my favourites by the band.  As before it's a favourite. No
291,a,"I remember writing my thesis and listening to this for up-beat motivation. The song has a nice beat and power. I enjoy the track because it makes me want to dance on my chair in the office. I don't have a real relationship with it, it just has a nice drive."
291,b,"It reminds me of a great music video, which sadly wasn't for this song and I can't remember the name. It's calm and comforting, and despite the death theme sounds positive. It's short and sweet. I just enjoy listening to it."
292,a,"Being a very, very drunk teenager and wondering why the room was spinning so much. This is my running playlist and this is a good, steady pace for me. Plus I love it. Unpolished production, gritty and sort of dirty. :) Yes. It's nostalgic. It reminds me of a great era and some lovely friends."
292,b,"A burst of energy. It's something I hadn't listened to in a while, and after watching a documentary on Debbie Harry a couple of weeks ago I save a few favourite old tracks to my phone. I enjoy the pace and emotion; again it's also nostalgic but this time of being a child. Not a particularly deep one. I listened to a lot of Blondie when I was 10 or so: my older sister was a fan and so all those tracks remind me a lot of home and childhood, but I don't have a specific relationship with this track."
293,a,"Reminds me of childhood. It's from the soundtrack to a film that was released when I was a child, based in the city I grew up in. This was on the radio A LOT when I was young!

Funnily enough, it came up in conversation a lot this week, so I laughed a little when it came on first by shuffle. I rediscovered it about 6 years ago, but ultimately it's an album that everyone from a certain part of the world is familiar with. It starts off quite mournful but it's got a lot of energy towards the end.Again, it's just something everyone would know and maybe even be a little sick of... Reminds me of being a child, growing up in a city that looks very different now to how it did when the song was released (1991), so it's very nostalgic. My mother had a cassette copy of the album plus it was on the radio a lot."
293,b,"Sun shining in the windows of an apartment I lived in years ago ...because I liked the album. See other responses maybe. The sound is quite upbeat... I can't say I'm incredibly familiar with it. It's from an album where i'd listen to the whole album and don't really know the names of the individual songs. This is an album I always saw sitting in my local HMV, maybe 10-15 years ago. I guess it was located close to some other artists I frequently bought... but I always noticed this one. Years passed before I decided to listen to it in early summer 2012, while living in Germany for a year. I listened to it for the first time either shortly before or shortly after ending a relationship. This might explain how her music made an impact in my long-term memory."
294,a,"Memories of a summer when I was 13 years old (11 years ago), it brings back how I felt at that time. I saved it recently to a 'Summer' playlist for nostalgia and as it puts me in a summery mood, since that's when I first discovered it.  Nostalgia and memories, the recording quality and 60s sound, the general excellence of Jimi as a musician! Yes, strong association with my early teens, a friend included it on a mix CD for me when I was 13!"
294,b,"I love the production of it so much One of my all time favourite tracks, I can listen to it over and over and never be tired of it The production and layers of it are incredible, its a collaboration between two artists I really like, I also love the lyrics Yes, I feel like listening to it is almost a spiritual experience! Very otherworldly, magical"
295,a,"AAF's music video to Smooth Criminal Good song that I enjoy hearing and sing8ng along to. The track reminds me of growing up, and I like the 90s/ 00s style softrock. No"
295,b,"Driving out to play a football match Its one of my favourite songs of all Gives the sense me against the world, my way or the highway sort of view. Not being afraid. Love the lyrics. No"
296,a,Reminds me of walking my dogs! I downloaded the album because I like Ed Sheeran.  Uplifting song.  Yes - it brings back positive memories of afternoon walks. 
296,b,Beautiful song Downloaded the album because I like Adele I love the lyrics and the sentiment.  Yes - brings back special memories 
297,a,"Oh, it seems to be named correctly now. That's nice.
Then...god, it's been a while I used to love this album, especially singing along to some of the songs. It's one of the albums I listened to as a teen when I still lived at at home.c I find it pleasing psychoacoustically (major, fastish tempo, nice harmonies - yes I have a music psych PhD)
Also it reminds me being younger Yes - I associate it with being a teenager, with my friend Fiona, or at the riding stables. It's one of the earlier songs I learned the words to. Feel free to related this to Vastfjall and Vuoskoski etc."
297,b,"I have no fucking clue what this is. It's part of the soundtrack to Howl's Music Castle It's minor, has a lot of dissonance Nope."
298,a,I do not know it well enough to say I saved the back catalogue of this artist because there are a few of the tracks I like and I like the general sound/genre that the artist works in I don't know it No. I don't know it
298,b,Nothing I did an event with this artist at one point and looked up their back catalogue afterwards I don't know it No
299,a,"It was used in a really interesting PS4 game called ""Life is Strange"". It's where I first heard it (and a few other tunes). I wanted to learn to play it on guitar but I guess mainly because it's a really pretty song. It's easy listening, beautiful vocals and while simple it's a really nice progression to play on guitar. Not in the same way as I would with songs that remind me of specific people or events but it will always be synonymous with the game that I first heard it in."
299,b,"A housemate of mine from 2nd year in University used to play this song all the time. He did a great version of it to. I think I have most of Muse's albums saved on Spotify - though it's been years since I listened to Showbiz. I think they make great music even though they wouldn't be a band I listen to much anymore. Ah the vocals in it are great. It's a fairly emotitive song too, makes me a bit nostalgic for the college days. Again, no not really. My most vivid memory of it is the relationship a good friend of mine had with it."
300,a,"It's pretty. Quite simple and understated - I like it.  I recently discovered Sarah Jarosz and saved a number of her tracks.  It's very pleasant to listen to. I sing along too.  Not really a deep connection. I like it but it's not particularly ""special"". "
300,b,It makes me smile.  I saved it when I was doing the couch to 5k running program. It's quite energetic and I hoped it would help with the running.  It's upbeat and energetic. A good motivator and useful tool to wake me up a bit.  Not really. It's a good fun song but I don't feel attached to it really. 
301,a,Never heard this before! I ripped the whole album but only really lsiten to a coupe of tracks from it It's upbeat and a surprise to hear! No - it is an unlistened to song on an album I ripped for a couple of other songs
301,b,"Seeind them in concert and a friend I don't see often who likes them It's on an album I ripped by a band I like It's rocky Yes - not a deep one but it's from a whole collection of music that I used to have the mickey taken out of me for liking, which I am now more confident about enjoying. I saw the band live in the O2 - I went alone and had a wonderful time."
302,a,"Snow and dark forest It is from the soundtrack to The Revenant movie, which I really enjoyed The soundtrack as a whole, is very well composed and orchestrated and very atmospheric. Not really. I listened to the soundtrack as whole, as an album, and because we are using shuffle this one has come up. It's actually quite short and just a reiteration of the main theme."
302,b,"A nice example of future bass music I wanted to get into producing some future bass. I listened to a number of well-subscribed playlists and highlighted tracks from those that I particularly enjoyed. This was one. I enjoy the timbres and composition, particularly the rhythmic elements. Not really. It is really just 'music for research' that I particularly enjoy."
303,a,Lyrics and melody  I love the band I like the melody and lyrics Yes it's one of many maximo park tracks I enjoy listening too 
303,b,Dreamy  I know the artist and find his tracks calying and soothing  It relaxes and calms me  Yes it reminds me of a friend and university days spent lounging in pubs and people's houses 
304,a,"Racial division I like the singers voice, the band, and the song The singer, the song the memories of the 90s No, I just like it"
304,b,"Being on the London Underground in the 80s I like the jam Very evocative lyrics, like Paul weller and the Jam No, once again I just like the song"
305,a,"Expressionist, flowing I collect and keep lossless files Detailed, evolving solo piano that stays interesting No, part of a very large collection of classical music but more of academic interest than a favourite composer. "
305,b,"Geometry Decent album Really nice harmonically rich synth arps and counterpoint Yes, I was given this album as a pre-release promo copy when I won a music production competition, along with some other stuff"
306,a,"It has been a very long time since I listened to this song. There was a time when I used to think Jeff Buckley was brilliant, but these days I don't feel very connected to his music. Listening to it I very much feel a melancholic longing back to my younger days when my life was simple enough that I could indulge in ""buckleyesce"" sensitivities. I used to be very much in that mindset, but growing older has rearranged my emotional priorities.  To be clear I want to point out that I do not use a listening device, I listen to all my music on youtube and do not make playlists. In order to get random song selection I scrolled down in my youtube suggestion list to the first song suggestion that I actually have listened to before. To my surprise, this came up. So I did not save it to my device, however I did do so many years ago when I first heard it. The reason back then was basically for research purposes (ie learning the parts), as I play guitar myself and thought it was brilliantly sung and"
306,b,"How do these songs end up in my suggested list! I haven't listened to it for so long, yet somehow youtube knows this is my music. I listened to Bob Dylan when I was quite young, finding the records in my dad's record collection, and got myself familiar on the guitar playing many of his songs. I have also listened to Johnny Cash a lot and like his delivery very much. The type of vibe that this performance gives off is one that comes very easy for me to create with my own music, although I do prefer a more european sound. I do like this song a lot;  the original recording of it by Bob Dylan has one of my all time favorite picking patterns. This particular performance is nice because Bob Dylan starts off singing his verse in his (at that time) regular style, after which Cash gives a very heartfelt rendition of his verse, changing the mood. Upon experiencing the delivery by Cash, Dylan subsequently adapts his delivery of the next verse to a similar passionate style. Again, not recently sav"
307,a,"I haven't heard this one in a while!  I have this entire album saved (Settle Down). It's only a minor track on here (less than a minute long) and I wouldn't have downloaded it on its own, simply because it's not worth the money to pay for a single track that short! I like all of Julia Nunes' music, and this one displays her talent for harmonies.  No. It's not my favourite track on the album, and, like I said, it's very short. "
307,b,"I don't remember this track at all... I don't have a lot of storage on my phone, and usually when I refresh the music contents I go through iTunes sync and select a few artists that I want to copy over to my phone. I think I was interested in downloading another of Marina's songs and ticked the artist box, but I probably wasn't specifically interested in this track. I'm not sure why I have it in the first place. Maybe I own the entire album, but I don't think I do...It could have been a free download at some point. It's just not very interesting musically. It doesn't have a good hook, and is barely memorable. No. As I said, it's not very memorable. "
308,a,"Smooth as a motherfucker Coz it's freakin' delicious  Makes me wanna dance but at the same time sit on a big couch bopping my head Yes. It's a good tune to stick on at the turning pint of a night. Gets people dancing and chatting but it's not mad intense. As I said, smooth as a motherfucker"
308,b,"Haven't heard this before but I like it Saved the album it comes from Beautiful strings, nice summery hip hop instrumental. Nice chopping and sampling No"
309,a,"The album cover and the fact that Patti Smith collaborated with Bruce Springsteen around this time. I didn't choose to save this particular track to my device, but rather the album it's on. (Also, this track is not actually saved on my device -- it's in the cloud.) This is a cover of a Roger McGuinn track originally recorded by The Byrds. I generally like McGuinn's writing and I think this is a well executed cover, although the 'big beat' drum production on the snare is a bit much -- era-appropriate, though. Not really. I have more of a relationship with the original version of the song, but not with this exact incarnation of it. I always want to like Patti Smith more than I do."
309,b,"A musician I once knew told me he thought The Attractions were the greatest backing band of all time. I really respect his opinion, so that comes to mind. I also thought of two other Costello tracks that I really like and listen to much more frequently: 'Green Shirt' and 'Little Triggers.' I think they're from the same record, definitely from the same era. Again, this track isn't saved on my device. It's in the cloud. I purchased it, and therefore added it to my cloud, because I really like Costello. High quality musicianship, good production, intelligent lyrics. Yes. I go through periods of listening to Costello every once in a while -- maybe once or twice a year. As such, it reminds me of driving on PCH or around town. (I listen to music a lot in my car.)"
310,a,"This is a great running track. It has kept me motivated lots of times. It makes me want to move. When I make running playlists, especially for specific events or training sessions, I want music that will spur me on. This still does that many years after I first heard it. It makes me want to move. Not really. It doesn't remind me of any specific runs. Some tracks I have on my ipod, I can remember hearing them at specific points in specific runs or events. "
310,b,"I love this film and my daughters love this film. I love this song as it's about the ancestors and how important they are which is a really strong message to pass on to my own children.  My daughters and I love the film and have the soundtrack. There are several songs on it (including this one) which are really rousing. I saved this track when I was making a running playlist for a recent half marathon. I was ordering songs carefully and this one kicked in at about 1.25 which was a time I thought I'd need extra encouragement and it's a great motivator.   It reminds me of my children and us singing along. Plus I like what the song stands for in regards to the importance of history and ancestors. Yes, it is linked to my children and various activities we have participated in with a Moana theme (parties, cinema trip, listening to the soundtrack on long journeys). It also came at a key point in a recent run which was my first half marathon in 8 years. A significant moment, really, and the m"
311,a,"I like the track I enjoy listening to it.  I like the beat/lyrics No, I don't think I have relationships with any tracks I've saved. "
311,b,"It makes me feel sad I like the song, despite the sadness, it perfectly summed up my mood at the time.  It reminds me of a period of time and how tough it was to get through but I made it.  No, same as before I don't think I have relationships with any tracks. "
312,a,"uplifting heard it and liked it instantly, just a feel good track Makes you feel good  No"
312,b,just to sit and enjoy part of an album makes me think  no
313,a,"I love the energy and rhythmicity of it. As soon as it started, I was bouncing around in my chair! I've seen the band play live, and when they perform this piece the percussionist sits at the front of the stage, and strikes a variety of objects extremely rapidly all the way through the piece, to a very tight and well-defined rhythm. I can visualise the physical effort and control he displays, and that feeds into my experience of the piece. But it's also generally a very lively and joyful piece -- I smile when I hear it -- so I don't feel the percussionist's physical effort as a strain, as such: more like extremely energetic dancing. I bought the CD at a gig by the Graham Fitkin band. I wanted to have the music to listen to, because I enjoy the pieces per se -- but it also lets me carry a bit of the memory of the gig around with me. As I mentioned above: energy, rhythmicity, joyfulness, memories of great nights spent watching the band. I feel I have a very physical relationship with thi"
313,b,"I haven't listened to this for a long time! I love Bartok, and particularly enjoy the folk influence in his rhythms, melodies and harmonies, but for various reasons this I haven't put this on for a while. I trained as a classical musician during my teenage years, and used to listen to a lot of classical music then -- this piece included. I remember having very strong experiences listening to this piece, particularly the last movement: real rushes of overwhelming joy and excitement. I bought the CD many years ago, and it was one of a group of particularly loved CDs that I uploaded to my iPod when I was first given it. Strong rhythm, folk influences on melody and harmony, contrapuntal interest, subtle and beautiful orchestration. It reminds me very much of the intense musical experiences I used to have listening to classical music as a young person. These days, I tend to listen to classical music when working or in the background; in those days I spent a lot more time actually sitting an"

316,a,"I feel as though I'm present in a different time. As a avid reader of my Bible, I would say that it signifies a connection with my personal religious beliefs. /I have Passion by Peter Gabriel and it is one of my most cherished. /I enjoy it because it is a good grounding song for me. I usually play Passion when I want to forget my worries and concentrate on completing my daily work. It puts me in a happier state of mind and helps me focus on the task at hand./Yes, most definitely.  It is a part of my regime for my daily work. "
316,b,"Loving the sounds of the various instruments, sounds melancholy./""I like the instrumental composition and the ethnic sound of the LyricsAlthough it sounds somewhat melancholy, it is still good to hear.""/It is a nice component on my Spiritual playlist. It is different from the other songs. /No, not yet. I need to translate the words of the song."
317,a,"Why didnâ€™t I ever get my summer camp band to play this back in the 90s?!/Memories/Memories of the summer of 95 working at a Salvation Army childrenâ€™s camp in Oregon/Yes - although itâ€™s a Christian band and iâ€™m an atheist, there was a time I listened to this (I want to say religiously but wonâ€™t) a lot - itâ€™s a good song to lose yourself in, providing in my case I ignore the lyrics!  I have the same relationship with N.W.A...!"
317,b,Wish iâ€™d Written it!/Inspiration - such a simple song. I could do that...!/Right key for me to sing along to./No - no deep rooted reason for having it on the playlist other than a singalong in the car.
318,a,"Cool, The Police/It is a song on an album by The Police. I like Sting, so I have a few of his albums./Sting has a great voice, great range./No, nothing special. As I said before, it's a track on an album. I haven't played or arranged it in any way, so no real relationship."
318,b,"Bluuuues. I'm loving this. Honestly, I had to think about it, because by the time I wrote in the title and author, I was way past the first thing that came to my mind./B.B. King was one of the best guitarist in the world and an icon in the world of blues music. I love his music./Great piece of music. Whatever mood I'm in B.B.King fits in perfectly./No. It is not one of those songs I regularly come back to."
319,a,"Going to see the Foo Fighters Live a couple of years ago /Because I love the Foo Fighters so saved all of their songs whether I know them or not to slowly try and discover them all/I enjoy listening to the track because the lyrics are uplifting and hopeful. I enjoy Dave Grohl's voice and the genre of music makes me think of a stereotypical care-free 'rock n roll' lifestyle. I like the harmonic difference of the middle eight compared to the rest of the song.   /Now, yes because I have been listening to it to complete these questions but I didn't have one previously. "
319,b,"I think the production techniques used on the track sound ugly and spoils the song/I like The White Stripes so save their music to my library so that I can find more songs of theirs I like additional to the ones I already know /I don't not enjoy this track because I find it interesting to analyse and enjoy the angsty vibe however, I find the quality of the tone created by the production techniques (especially on the vocals) grating /Not previously to completing this survey, but now I have a relationship with it in that I have answered these questions on it "

321,a,"It is very good and pleasant. Great music to take a shower to./I love harpsichord music and Gustav Leonhardt's playing/I enjoy it because it keeps me energized/No, I have only listened to this particular piece once"
321,b,"W0w! Jazz is so nice/good/cool, and Miles Davis' playing is extraordinary! SUCH GOOD TONE OMG/Birth of the Cool is kind of an extremely important jazz album and I added when I first got into more traditional forms of bebop (this is from that album)/I enjoy listening to it because the craft of the musicians is superb/No, not with this specific track, but I do listen to the album a lot"
322,a,"Challenging./Didn't.  App did that for me.  Was researching Per Norgard's music in advance of a scratch orchestra workshop playing a piece by him./Not my kind of music.  Struggle to understand it.  Sounds random and directionless.  Sort of get that it's a sound ""poem"", painting with music.  Would not have that insight without the recent workshop mentioned above, when I had the opportunity to play another piece by Per Norgard./Not really.  Was the first Norgard track that popped out of Spotify when I searched."
322,b,"Triumphant and happy./Again, not sure I did.  Don't know how to do that - rather a Luddite with tech stuff.  Don't use an iPod.  Just listen to stuff at random./Lovely orchestral piece.  Light and interesting.  Lovely instrumental solos.  Lilting and easy to listen to.  Relaxing.  Helps me to concentrate./Not really.  Like Mozart generally.  Probably makes me very musically ""populist"".  Feel I have some small understanding or where a piece is going, and what it's trying to convey.  It has some emotional value for me.  "
323,a,Peaceful tune/I like the original song and I like this cover because she has a beautiful voice./Lovely song and a nice relaxing one to listen to at the end of the day or while working./No I don't have any particular relationship/memories associated with this song.
323,b,"A bit embarrassed, to be honest!/I liked a couple of the more popular songs from Justin Bieber's most recent album and it was easier to just download the whole album. To be honest, I don't know this song at all and don't really like it./It's a bit too techno-y./No, I liked a few of the other songs on the album and listened to them A LOT, but I don't know this one and have never listed to it the whole way through."
324,a,"Slow, melodic, depressing/I like to musicality of the travk/it makes me thoughtful/no"
324,b,"Summer/happy/thoughtful//Really like the band/MAKES ME THINK OF HAPPY TIMES/Yes, sort of. I have known the track for a ling time and it brings back times gone"
325,a,"Car journey up north with my mate./Good song, even better album./Got a good sort of beat, like calvin harris's music, me and my mate both love this album./Yes, in a way, only that it brings back memories of our music on our many hours in a car together."
325,b,"The music video for this song comes to mind first for some reason./Liked the original, love oliver heldens, put the two together, pretty awesome remix./Really good remix of a good song, puts me in the clubbing mood./No not really, just really like it, always liked oliver heldens."
326,a,"It reminds me of being in LA/I just love the song, really great vibe. /I think it's really interesting songwriting and it just makes me feel good!/Not really other than liking the song. "
326,b,"I feel excited when it starts playing as it's such a cool build up before he starts singing - a lot of anticipation. /Again I absolutely love it. /I love the lyrics, I love his voice. This version in particular is a live one and it's so atmospheric./I think I do yes. The lyrics are really meaningful to me, and it's a song a really close friend and I have discussed so it feels like it's part of that somehow. "
327,a,"Surprised but pleased to hear it/It was recommended to me by my boyfriend./It's quite upbeat, I like their voices- I like most of their songs!/Yes- we would always listen to the album on long car journeys in the summer, it brings back happy memories."
327,b,"I don't know the music lingo to say exactly what I like it, but their music is unusual and yet super satisfying to listen to, so excitement!/It is a brilliant album. /I haven't overplayed it yet!/It triggers a memory of winter... I don't know if that's a relationship as such but I just get these feelings taking me back to when walking home in the cold and then getting into a warm car and listening to it."
328,a,"Sheep/I enjoy listening to Mike/Easy listening track. Lyrics are about life./No, I don't tell lies."
328,b,The future /Easy listening artist sings about life /I purchase all music by passenger he is a local artist and enjoy his music/Not really 
329,a," Slightly like slipknot. it reminds me of the game ""need for speed underground 2"" a little. The repetitive riffs make me think of grinding the same missions or tasks in work or certain games. There is a certain anger, or energy brought by the vocals that makes me knuckle down, but the guitar is mostly happy and upbeat.  /went through a phase of listening to the GazettE, but i still think its good./energetic and upbeat. I don't get too distracted by the lyrics as I don't speak Japanese. helps me focus and power through./nope. It's just a song I quite like."
329,b,"OOOhhh hot damn. It makes me think of early summer with my partner, looking out of our (fictional)apartment in the city, taking in the morning sunshine. preparing to make plans for the park, food, later that evening games. all the while dreaming in her eyes, dancing my fingers across her skin... and so on./because it's great. almost always makes a bad mood good and a good mood better./the music is very warm and happy. The lyrics remind me of love of course, but it reminds me of my granddad. In his stories he likes to portray himself as a confident slick gentleman, always had a way to sweep the women off their feet and always had a joke for the lads. He was brought up without much money, but had such a connection to people. So it makes me imagine myself as a smooth talking gent speaking full of love to my partner, in a way that we don't need money or a grand life, just each other and a bright new day./I really feel it's a simple song that says a lot, so I went to learn it to impress my "

331,b,"I love this song, calming and world peace /Makes me emotional /Beautiful song /Yes. Amazing lyrics "
332,a,"The beat is very catchy/It's a fun and upbeat song to listen and dance to/It's got a good beat and it's fun to see if you can remember all the many many lyrics/Yes, me and my friends used to listen to for a silly break when we were revising US history because it's got lots of things about 20th century history in the lyrics."
332,b,"The nice tinkly piano intro/I've always liked the song/It's empowering and fun to sing along to/Yes, my dad really likes the song"
333,a,"Very calming and relaxed/Catchy enough that I can listen to it many times/Good production value, nice instrumentals/No, I just enjoy it as a song to listen to"
333,b,"It's not really the kind of thing I usually listen to/I downloaded the whole album at a friend's request, I enjoy a couple of the songs but not this one /It's quite repetitive and slow/No, it's only on the playlist because I downloaded the whole album "

334,b,"Hallucinating and trance like/For my History III exam/Hypnotic but also interesting /No, I just began to listen to it for my exam and have not listened to it since"
335,a,"Abstract./I study contemporary composition./It is technically interesting and has moments of beauty, but ultimately the harmonic language and lack of a perceivable beat alienates me. /No."
335,b,"Cheesy./I like a lot of music by Ray Charles, though not all of it, including this song. However, this track is on an album of his I chose to import. /The sweeping strings and orchestration throughout make it cheesy in my eyes (ears). It also lacks a groove./No"
336,a,"It reminds me of when I used to listen to it with friends around 18 months ago. I also subsequently went to see this act live, so I think of when I was there hearing this live./I saved it to this playlist to listen to when walking around./I enjoy it because of the memories it evokes, which in turn remind me of why I liked the song in the first place - I think it's quite atmospheric and gradually builds throughout the song but doesn't really go anywhere./Yes, because it is intimately linked to the social situations in which I used to listen to it."
336,b,"I used to listen to this playlist walking around so I vaguely associate it with walking around in the summer/I have it on a playlist I like to listen to when walking around so I suppose it is because of the atmosphere the song creates which I like to have/I enjoy it because I think it is an interesting track/No, I haven't listened to it very much, or as much as other tracks, so I don't feel I have such a relationship with it"
337,a,"I love Aquilo, but haven't listened to them for ages. /I saw Aquilo at a festival a couple of years ago and felt a connection to their music, so when their album finally came out I saved the full LP to my Spotify. I haven't listened to this track much./From the title you expect it to be sad, but it's actually up lifting. The lyrics are very honest. /No"
337,b,"I love this song, especially the acoustic version because Sigrid sounds so raw. The lyrics are empowering. It makes me feel good. /I had it on repeat for a while. /I find the lyrics relatable. I enjoy listening to this track when I need reminding why I started. It's a strong message about not letting anyone bring you down and standing up for who you are, and what you believe in. /When I first heard the song, I thought it was about a boy, love, a relationship â€“ the usual stuff girls sing about. I did some reading around the song and I learned it was written about a session that didn't go so well. Then the song took on a whole new meaning for me. I recently saw Sigrid live with my best friend and we both relate to this song in the same way. So that was a moment. "
338,a,"It gives me energy. /I saved it as soon as the album came out so I could learn the lyrics and get to know the song better before seeing RTJ perform it live. /I run and workout to this track. Or if I'll listen before a night out. I love the lyrics. It's a fun track. /Yes. I've seen RTJ live a few times, at the Roundhouse and at a few festivals including Primavera Sound in Barcelona. It takes me back to the summer. "
338,b,I used to have it on repeat but haven't played it for ages. /I liked another song by Vaults so I saved their album. /I like the lyrics and the production. /No.
339,a,"Happiness, swing dancing/I saw the show on Broadway in August, and fell in love with the songs, music, and story of love and swing dancing.  It makes me feel happy and want to dance./I enjoy the singers voice, and tune of the music.  I can imagining dancing to it.  The song, story is about the character's determination to succeed./""YesI love swing dancing, and it's swing music.  I saw the show, and the bought the CD."""
339,b,"Swing dancing, happiness./I already had two other versions of this song on my iPod.  And love the song, so wanted another version, so I could listen to them all one after one another./It's romantic, makes me forget about life, and just concentrate on the beat of the music./""Yes"
340,a,Epic...beautiful...haunting...poetic...evocative/All the reasons above...its glorious/Its one of those great tracks that builds to a climax and doesn't disappoint... great dynamics.../Its like a well appreciated mistress...

341,a,"My Dad. He used to play the guitar and sing the song to me when I was a child./I find it really uplifting and positive due to the memories it evokes, and I also think it's a really nice song./It really relaxes me and gives me space to think./Yes. It's a track from my childhood. My Dad used to play the song when I was a toddler in the bath."
341,b,"You know the guitar part coming is going to be spine tingling...more emotions in about 2 minutes of playing than an entire season of ...../Aural pleasure...pure and simple...like dripping honey to my ears.../It scales heights few get near...and you know its going to make you reach for the old air guitar.../I dare say we were bedfellows at some juncture...Darkness, stars and flashing lights./It's upbeat, rhythmically fun and melodically simple. It's great to sing and walk along to./I find that I can feel the music throughout my whole body. It makes me want to move and tap and create music of my own. It also allows me a lot of thinking space, to imagine other things and think about ideas/possibilities/scenarios freely./Yes, it's a track I share with my brother. We will sing along to it whenever we are together and it comes on, and I can't help but think of that whenever it comes on."
342,a,"Vocals are low for a female voice./The strong beat is great for running./It is repetitive enough that it is easy to understand and remember, and the beat makes you want to move/dance./Yes. The song transports me to the times when I had the most frequent exposure to it (in the gym in my hometown), which means it is positive to me."
342,b,Uplifting/empowering/It is empowering./The lyrics are uplifting and the beat is strong./Yes. I have listened to it frequently and carefully enough that it means something to me.
343,a,"Danny Brown's high pitched inflection, which is always a smile-inducing moment.  /Because Atrocity Exhibition, which is the album White Lines is on, is a great and experimental listen - ""White Lines""is no exception. Also, I only ever listen to albums front to back, so no song is deleted from the album until I've made my mind up on the project in its entirety. /Because the instrumentation is amazing, Danny Brown is charismatic and lyrical on the track, and the whole concept of the song takes various detours, which is also awesome. /Music means the world to me, and every song I listen to evokes some type of feeling. White Lines does evokes a few different feelings and moods, depending on what part of the song is playing. "
343,b,"The emotional background vocals and the piano in the intro. It's right up my street./Because after listening to ""The Color in Anything"" it was one of about a handful of tracks I enjoyed listening to. And, it's a pretty as well as low key piece of music. /It's a pretty and emotional track, with a great chord progression as well as a nice instrumental build-up. Good vocals too. /To me it's a great track for darker, colder days. Not at all in a depressing way, but it has a cozy feel to me, despite it not being a super blissful track. "
344,a,"Its fun and makes me feel more upbeat. Sounds like summer to me, so makes me feel optimistic. I've often thought it would be a good alarm clock song because of the lyrics 'wake up now'./It's part of a Sunday playlist I have made when I am busy in the flat. Its upbeat so motivates me to do household chores/Its lively and makes me move more which gets my heart pumping and in turn gives me energy/Not really, it doesn't evoke memories, I just like it"
344,b,"I think it was originally from a movie soundtrack, so reminds me of a film/I shazamed it when I watched the movie because i hadnt heard it before and liked it/I find it dramatic and contemplative. Evokes my imagination, it is quite dreamy /Just from the movie"
345,a,"See the story below under ""Do you have a relationship with this track?""/All the music I own is saved to my iPod./KMD's music makes me feel nostalgic. I was only a toddler when it was coming out, but it was some of the first underground hip-hop that I got into and, because I only rarely listen to KMD these days, it brings me back to that time in my life./I actually prefer the track that follows this one on the album, but for a long time I thought that this title belonged to that track, which caused me confusion when I tried to put it on."
345,b,"I can't say that I know this song!/All the music I own is saved to my iPod. I bought a compilation, The Essential Daryl Hall & John Oates, because I like a handful of their hits, so I transferred that whole album to my iPod./I find a lot of Hall & Oates a tad cheesy for my taste, but I really enjoy their more upbeat tracks./I have no particular relationship with this song. In fact I can't really say I remember it."
346,a,"It's happy and upbeat, with a nice brass solo at the start and good beat 2 and 4 clapping that wants you to join in from the start!/I like this album as it has a lot of my favourite church songs and I enjoy singing along./It has lyrics which are uplifting and it is so catchy so I love joining in! I love the use of brass as well rather than just a normal band with guitars, vocals, keys and drums./Yes - I sing this at church so it has personal meaning to me."
346,b,I love the gentle acoustic guitar picking and the lyrics start straight away and I know this song very well so immediately I am engaged because I find this song so peaceful and it brings me joy./It is one of my favourite songs at church which I just find calms me and fills me with peace. It is from an album full of my favourite church music./I love being able to sing along and feel at peace and full of joy as the lyrics really speak to me./Yes - I perform it with my siblings and with friends at church so it has lots of meaning for me.
347,a,"Uplifting, feeling confident /Motivates me /It makes me feel confident /No"
347,b,"Bank holiday at Victorious Festival with my best friend /Reminds me of a wonderful few days over bank holiday, great weather and great friends/It's uplifting and brings back happy memories /Yes, reminds me of bank holiday"
348,a,"Ben Howard's a bit of an embarrassing artist to have on the playlist! But it's a gorgeous song/It's a great song that's nice and slow to relax to/It's been a while since I've heard it and it's a beautiful, slow melody/Yes a little bit, I was listening a lot to this artist a few years ago when a relationship wasn't going so well, and it's the kind of song you listen to when you're feeling a bit lonely "
348,b,"Stunningly beautiful song by my favourite band/It's by my favourite band and it's an incredible song, I couldn't not have it saved/The lyrics are gorgeous, the melody's are incredible, and it creates such a strong emotion of something but you're not exactly sure of what/Yes, I probably have at least some relationship with pretty much every song I have saved. I was listening to this band and this album when I was about 17 and not really enjoying school or my personal life and this band helped me to feel like there was a little more out there. "
349,a,I love the lyrics - a very familiar song./I love the lyrics so I can sit and listen to it or sing along. It's also good a steady rhythm and is quite calming so is good to do housework or study to./It is familiar to me and brings back memories./Yes - I have listened to this song lots so I have memories of doing different things with this music in the background.
349,b,"This is fun, I haven't listend to this song in ages./It is a song that was in an album which I knew quite well but I didn't really know this song./It's got a really good drum beat and I love the lyrics./No - I have only listened to it a few times and not intentionally, I hear it in the background when I've been listening to this album but I don't massively know it."
350,a,"The first time I heard it, when practicing for a band I was singing in for a Christian Union event at Leeds University./The songs lyrics are really important to me as a Christian: 'Find me here at your feet again, everything I am, reaching out I surrender'. Those words are something I try to do daily, and so I have in my playlist to worship God./Important lyrics, catchy tune = enjoyable/Yes - I use it as a way to praise and worship God."
350,b,"How true and relevant the lyrics are./It's a worship song I have loved since I first heard Rend Collective live at 'Soul Survivor' a Christian week in summer for teenagers. /I enjoy the melody, it has an folk song feel that is fun./Yes, as a song of worship it helps me to connect and praise God. The song makes me excited to worship God and it's lyrics help remind me of the truth of the Gospel, that God will lead me through any storm."

354,a,"""Reminds me of a weird period in my life ""/I bought the album but it is not the song i usually listen to/It was not the song I wanted to have but came part of the album/No, not this track but with the artist for other songs"
354,b,"Reminds me of the movie that I really liked. Rita looked very sexy in the movie and the music serves as a reminder to this. Her dances were great/I really liked it in the movie and then searched a long time on youtube. When i found it i had to save it on my phone/Makes me happy! ... and same as above. Reminds me of he great move and Rita acting in it. /Yes, through the movie and singer. It reminds me of the people i watched the movie with, especially my best friend"

358,a,"The Olympics, I think for some reason, I confuse it in my mind Vangelis and associate it with Chariots of Fire./I really enjoy the combination of powerful natural percussion and synthetic melody as well as the use of dynamics./It is powerful and rousing for when motivation is low./No. It's just a tune that I've probably picked up as part of my dad's influence"
358,b,"Learning to play the lead guitar part as a young teenager in a bid to impress my bandmates./I was a big fan of the Britpop era when I first started listening to music and had the Moseley Souls album on cassette as a child./It has a really strong guitar riff and I like the texture of the vocals./Yes.

360,a,"Fun! Also, an A level set piece that I tutored a neighbour on a few years ago, and one of the first pieces I owned on LP as a teenager./As part of tutoring an A level student./It reminds me of the TV cartoon 'Ludwig' (1980?) which used this music and prompted me to buy the LP. The cartoon 'Ludwig' (and its music - all Beethoven!) validated my interest in classical music, which otherwise set me somewhat apart from peers at school./""?? I don't understand this question, beyond what I've said above - which IS my relationship to this track. (So it's a 'Yes' and 'As above')I don't listen to it regularly - only Shuffle brought it up. But a delight!"""
360,b,"My son, who has downloaded this track on my account (a family sharing one). He also plays guitar, and sometimes plays along to Linkin Park tracks - one of his favourite bands./As above, it was my son who actually saved the track. But this was with my permission, so part of supporting his interest in music./It's a bit raucous for me - unfamiliar, and neither 'beautiful' nor 'interesting' - but this shows my ignorance of the genre and the band as much as anything./Only through my son, who listens to it. 'No' - it's the first time I've heard it."
361,a,"Such a good tune, even though I'm not sure why I like it so much. It's very upbeat, catchy and a good song to belt out. I can imagine myself driving in my car with this song on full volume, singing along very loudly and being rather embarrassing. /My iPod is pretty old and I don't update it often so I usually keep lots of older songs on there. I saved this on my iPod quite a few years ago because I was a fan of their music. I've always liked Maroon 5 so I haven't really got a reason to take it off. /Maroon 5 is a bit of a guilty pleasure for me. This Love is just such a classic song- everyone knew it when I was younger and people would always absolutely love it when it came on./I wouldn't say I have a particular personal relationship with this track but it often puts me in a good mood when I hear it. "
361,b,"I love the Black Keys but it's kind of bitter sweet because my ex-boyfriend gave me this album so it unfortunately reminds me of him./My ex-boyfriend gave me the CD as a present and I really liked it so put it on my iPod. /Although the track does have some negative connotations for me, I still do really like the song. It's good to sing along to and a bit different from some of the other more cheesy music on my iPod. I think I would enjoy it more if it didn't bring back certain memories./I wouldn't say I have a particular relationship with this specific track- more with the band. I think as time has gone on, I've associated it with my ex-boyfriend less and less but I don't think I'll be able to listen to it without vaguely thinking about him in one way or another. "
362,a,"The point in the story when it is, and how emotional this scene is. /I really love Wicked and like to listen to showtunes when working/in general/It's quite steady and relaxing so it's a nice song to just listen to when I want a quiet moment/Wicked was one of the first musicals I ever listened to in full and have seen more than once, so this song and soundtrack in general has quite a nostalgic and reassuring feel to me. "
362,b,"Childhood throwback. /I quite like revising to this kind of beat - helps me tune out from the world around me. /I like the musicality of it, plus it has a nice beat and you don't really need to focus on the song too much - it can just play in the background. /Not really, it's just a song to me that I remember from year 8 and occassionally pops up on my shuffle."
363,a,"Motivation /It's catchy, but also a feel good song. It's a great track to walk to, or to listen to when going to the gym. /It has a good beat that makes it very catchy. Easy to dance to. /Yes - I have been listening to it lots for the past few days. Have been feeling quite angry with a particular person, so it's been a great song to listen to for feel-good purposes, and to motivate me to focus on other good things instead. "
363,b,"Sexy /Have always been a fan of the artist/group /It's a catchy tune, and feels very sexy /No - it doesn't necessarily mean a lot to me, it's simply just a song that I listen to to feel good about myself"
364,a,"Seeing the band live in Tokyo two summers ago in a live house in Shibuya./The whole album by Melt-Banana is amazing, so I downloaded the whole thing./Interesting mix of repetitive guitar loops at the beginning and musique concrÃ¨te-esque weird croaking sounds in the second part of the song. I really enjoy how unapologetically strange their style is; the guitar part could've maybe gone on for longer though./No, I haven't listened to that many times and I don't feel like I have any kind of emotional connection with the song. However, it does evoke nice memories of my holiday in Japan so maybe that's a small connection ? "
364,b,"Listening to Arctic Monkeys in school. I still have all the songs from back then and they remind me of how much my tastes have changed./I used to be into them in school - don't listen to them anymore though so I'm not really sure why I still have them on iTunes./It feels a bit standard, like pretty normie/vanilla stuff. If it played on the car radio I'd turn it up and enjoy it but I'd never choose to put it on./No. It reminds me of school days but nothing much else."
365,a,"Amazing song to dance to, very uplifting music, but with bitter lyrics!/Absolutely love it, it's a perfect pop song./Great feel good song, despite the lyrics!/No; I discovered it through the Soft Cell cover version. Then when I discovered Gloria Jones was Marc Bolan's partner and that she was driving the car that he died in the song had a whole back story that is both beautiful and sad like the song."
365,b,"Takes me back to my teenage years, listening to the track on a Walkman./It's a favourite of mine, probably in the all time top 30/Absolutely love it!/Yes, when I was 15 I borrowed my brother's copy of New Order's album Substance and listened to it over and over discovering lots of new and amazing songs including this."
366,a,"Happy, chilled vibes/A well-known artist amongst our generation/Many of my favourite artists all in one track/No"
366,b,"Emotional but chilled vibes/Quite a catchy song, good beat/Lyrics have meaning.../No"
367,a,"How a love has gone bad/It's on an album I downloaded, therefore saves automatically/I like the band, I like the track. It tells me a story. It has a good vocalist. I like the music./Yes. I have a relationship with all tracks. This one is telling me of a yearning for a relationship not to be perceived as bad, and wishing it wasn't bad. But in reality, and to outsiders, it is not a healthy relationship."
367,b,"Wicked bass and riffs./It was on an album that I downloaded, so is automatically saved./It's a track from my favourite band. /Yes - it tells me of how painful relationships can be, of how one longs for a real connection with another, rather than all the shallow bullshit you get."
368,a,"Sounds very British /I have all the albums of this band as I like the band, so of course I would have this particular song too /This song is not really my favourite from the album/the band, it's all right but I don't think it's that special, so I'm pretty neutral about it. /No, I don't have any relationship with this particular track, it's not one of my favourites. "
368,b,"It's from the movie Dirty Dancing. /I really like it. /It reminds me of Dirty Dancing as it was used as a soundtrack in the movie and I really enjoyed the movie. /Rather than this particular track, I have a relationship to the movie Dirty Dancing where it was used as a soundtrack. I used to watch this movie with someone very important to me and we both loved it and every time we watched it we had a great time. So this song simply evokes good memories. "
369,a,It's a classic song/I downloaded the whole album as it was very cheap and I liked some of the other songs on it. /It's chilled and easy to listen to/No
369,b,"I'm pleased it's come up on shuffle/I really like the artist and the whole album/It's very chilled and I like the singer's voice/Yes, I listen to it quite often "
370,a,"I think of the time I saw this band live, and also makes me think of running by the sea as I used to listen to his song alot when running./I downloaded the whole album to listen to, normally when traveling on public transport or in the car or when out running./It is a fun and upbeat track./Yes - due to memories associated with hearing it live (when I had a nice evening out with a friend and enjoyed the concert) and listening to it alot when running in a nice environment by the sea."
370,b,"It is quite silly./It is on an album which I downloaded to listen to when driving in the car./It feels quite silly but tells a little story. It is quite fun to sing along too./Not really, I just think it is quite a funny song."
371,a,Vintage Rock/It's one of the best songs from the last 5 years/I enjoy listening to this track because this kind of stoner/psych rock is one of my favourite genres/No
371,b,"Great bass/Because of its bass part/As a bass player, I love to air play this song's bass part/No"
372,a,"Love the beat/Interesting production, great groove to the tune, I'm tapping my foot and swaying to the beat almost immediately./It's the beat and groove with this one. No lyrics, which adds a nice variety./No. I'm playing this off a main playlist that contains 3k or so songs. I don't really listen to albums anymore, just stick this playlist on shuffle, so whenever I come across something I like I add it to this playlist and every now and then it'll bubble to the top again."
372,b,"Interesting guitar riff with a good beat./Because it's a great track. Love singing this in the shower./It's a great marriage of beat and lyric. Dave Gahan has always been an interesting lyricist./Other than liking the band, not really."
373,a,"It happens to be the first track of the album, it makes me think of the album as a whole, about the album cover, and the time I saw this band play live. /I own the physical CD and wanted to have it available to listen to in my digital playlist as well./It's catchy; interesting instrumentation (especially in the chorus). /Yes, it reminds me of when I saw the band play live. "
373,b,"I don't recognise it./My playlist includes lots of instrumental music, which I like listening to during work or in the evening. Sometimes I add new albums, this one in particular I haven't had a chance to listen to much to yet./It's calming, and a pretty arrangement. /No, as I don't really know it (yet)."
374,a,"What a rare and random song to listen to, forgot I loved this song!/This was from a live show last year that I wanted to go to but couldn't, so I downloaded the show to listen to ./it's a great song, only complaint is it isnt the greatest quality recording/Yes, it's from a show in Boston that I wanted to go to but couldnt. This is not one of my favorite songs but would have loved to see it live"
374,b,"Funky, I want to dance!/I recently downloaded this album because I love this band and hadn't heard this album before. /Funky and fun music, no lyrics, just great to listen to, especially at work /Not really since I haven't really listened to it more than once (bc it was just added to my itunes last week)"
375,a,"It's not necessarily the first song I would have picked for myself, but I still like it/I like it/It's a good song/Not really, it's just a song I like."
375,b,"The time we sang it a karaokee/I like it/It's a fun song/Kind of. I mostly saved it because I like it, but we did sing it at the holiday party karaoke once."
376,a,"Scrubs (TV-Series), Handmaid's Tale (Netflix Series)/because I heard it in the two series above and liked it/I like its upbeat feeling and that it is different to what I normally hear/not really, I indicated the relationship above"
376,b,"programming computer music/because I like it and because I feel it summarises quite well what I do on a daily basis/because it is funny, for the reason giving above, it is interesting and not something you often hear in the outside world/as indicated above, I feel it is the hymn of computer scientists"
377,a,"Memories about concerts from this band that I've attended /Loved it as a teenager and still do. Lots of nostalgia attached to this song./I enjoy it both for the memories associated, and also because the song is upbeat, energetic and resonates with me./Yes, only in the sense I listened to it as a teenager always wanted to go to their concerts and finally got to go while I was in undergrad."
377,b,"Running/Exercise/I chose this track to have on my running playlist as well as to play while I do other physical activities/exercise./It is an upbeat, song with a strong beat that makes me want to move./Yes- I like to run to this song."
378,a,"The lyrics mean something/I like to listen to it before I go to sleep and imagine it playing alongside aspects of my own life./I love the build up./Yes, I feel like i relate to the lyrics big time."
378,b,"It's different/Lyrics give perspective/I enjoy it because it is full of emotion, also the flow of the music is really nice to listen to./No, I just think it is a bit of an inspirational song, that's really nice to listen to."
379,a,"It's from A level music â€“Â we studied it in upper sixth. Frankly it's kind of a ridiculous piece â€“Â it has these mad trombone glisses all over the place â€“ the whole concept of a movement with tenor trombone and double bass soloists is a bit mad. It's a good performanceÂ â€“ I haven't listened to this recording much but it's very energetic./I listen to a quite eclectic range of music, this piece cheers me up because it reminds me of sixth form music lessons â€“ I also play it to people to show them Stravinsky isn't all dissonant and scary. I saved it to my phone because I intended to play it on student radio last term./It's a very cheerful piece â€“ I can't really think of anything that sounds remotely like it. It's one of those pieces that can actually make you laugh out loud the first time you hear it â€“ although that may be just the comedic value of a  well timed trombone gliss.../Yes - it was a set work for my A level music â€“ and then came up again in my degree when studyin"
379,b,"The instrumentation - and the recording - are sublime. There are also a ton of nice modulations, and a sick trumpet solo. /It's part of the Sgt. Pepper album â€“ one of my favourite beatles albums./It's just really well written â€“Â the modulations, harmony, instrumentation, lyrics are all amazing. Also you can't not be cheered up by a clarino trumpet solo in a pop song. It's happy and melancholy at the same time./Yes â€“ my music teacher loves the beatles, this album in particular. We did a concert of Beatles music in school â€“Â he arranged all the pieces for choir and orchestra, it was incredible."
380,a,"Matches situations I've been in recently when I felt like I was being messed with, getting mixed messages about whether or not a particular person wanted me around./I listen to it while training on a rowing machine/It also reminds me of painting the kitchen with my parents, which happens to be a time when I took control of my social situation (with their help) and made my own decision to separate from the person who was messing me around.  So the memory of that helps me to feel strong, which I guess is important on a rowing machine./Yes.  See above."
380,b,"Rowing/To use while rowing/It's a ""hype track"" which I picked up by suggestion from another rower, not because I found it for any personal reason or enjoyed it the first time I listened.  I've just taken it off my playlist haha/Not really"
381,a,"Omg! I have listened to this song so many times but it is still exciting! How is it posiible? It is a magical composition!/This song gives me chills every time when I am listening to it. It is also very inspiring for me becouse I am a singer and I would like to improve my vocal technique by listening to it./As I said, this composition is magical, it gives me chills and it can move my mind to the other world, when I am free. /Yes, if the relationship between a track and a person is possible. This track is my teacher, my ""guru"" how to compose and also how to sing. And I also like the singer- Floor Jansen."
381,b,"Oh, I didn't remember that I have this song on my playlist! Am I really going to like it? Wait... Yes! That's totally cool! But have I checked the lyrics? They are sometimes stupid... Anyway- music is nice!/I don't remember, but probably it was about the music style- I love symfonic metal. The vocal is also great and the choir and the guitar solo. It can be kind of my inspiration to compose my own stuff./This is my favourite kind of music- symfonic metal. The vocalist has got also kind of a good technique which can inspire me to be a better vocalist./No, becouse I didn't remember that I have saved this song. This is kind of a stranger for me, but who knows, maybe we can be metaphorical ""friends"" in the future."
382,a,Dancing in a club/A well known tune that everyone is familiar with making it perfect for a party/social gathering/Enjoyable to sing/Yes - memories singing in a club
382,b,I imagine sitting in the Apollo Victoria theatre in london watching Wicked and loving every single moment of it/I love this song and I love pretending I'm on stage when I sing it/Memories of watching wicked; I love the melody and harmonies/Yes - watching wicked with my mum and friends
383,a,"medieval times, Middle Age/I like the combination of medieval music or melodies and symphonic metal/It's a powerful and melodic song that provides positive motivation/No, I just found the album some years ago and liked the music"
383,b,"summer feelings/It is a summer track, easy to listen to, creating good mood./The track creates vacation feeling and reminds me of summer holidays. Thus perfectly suitable on an autumn day to lift the mood./No, just heard it on the radio and decided to save it in my playlist."
384,a,I dont know it that well/I saved the whole album /It's upbeat and different to what I normally listen to/No
384,b,"This track makes me nostalgic for a music gig that I went to 5 years ago/I like the song/I have listened to this song in a long time, therefore it is nice to hear it again/Yes - this song was one of the first songs I heard live"
385,a,"It feels very remote, kind of non-existent. It doesn't have a very sonically prominent melody or rhythm, or more accurately any one that feels consistent structurally, absent minded improvisationally/Because I recorded it for a friend's record/Because it represents a facet of a friend's musical personality - I think it is an interesting musical experiment/Yes - i recorded a friend performing it"
385,b,"Feels large, spacious, important - also professionally recorded/It was given to me by a ex girlfriend as part of some recordings to listen to in Bangkok four years ago/It is a very interesting and beautiful piece of film music, and it evokes a certain emotional response personally./Yes, both the music and my possession thereof relates directly to a past relationship"
386,a,"This is a song my roommate actually knows. (Our music tastes do not overlap but she happened to be introduced to this song through a mutual friend and took a liking to.)/It's an iconic song from the series Higurashi no Naku Koro ni which I enjoyed.  /It's a really calming song and the vocals are pretty./Yes, in the sense that I've been listening to it for over 7 years now. Like I mentioned before, my roommate and I have very different tastes in music so it was kind of exciting for me when she expressed a liking for this song, going as far as wanting to learn how to play it on the piano. "
386,b,"Oh this is a fun and catchy song./I'm a fan of marasy's piano covers, so I saved most of the songs from this particular album. I'm actually not too familiar with the original song, but I enjoyed how his cover sounded so I saved it./It's catchy and the piano keeps driving forward./Not really. Like I mentioned before, I'm not too familiar with the original on which this cover is based. I have heard the original, but it's very produced, as one expects a pop song to be, and I very much prefer the pure sounds of the piano in this cover."
387,a,"it's light and playful, just like a Rondo should be/I love Mozart's violin concertos/This concerto brings out the best of Mozart - he uses his signature playful melodies that are so likable, but also takes us on a journey with the piece./My violin teacher played this concerto at her violin recital, which I attended quite a few years ago. I fell in love with the piece after I heard it there. "
387,b,"inspiring music/it's a good song/it's pretty upbeat, makes me feel good. It's one of the tracks on my running playlist, so it gets me pumped and energized/Not really... I just remember hearing it sometime around 7th or 8th grade"
388,a,"Reminds me of high school/Its a jam, catchy, fan of demi. Its your typical feel-good pop song/It is acoustically pleasing, has catchy rhythms /No"
388,b,"Love this track, one of my favorite bands, favorite track of this record/Huge fan of the band, relate to the song./I feel like both lyrically and musically i relate to this track. Acoustically pleasing, good for when I need really loud music to block out the world. /Yes. This song is literally me when I was 18, dealing with becoming an adult, coping with anxiety and depression just needing help and feeling like i was on my own/lost about the world. "
389,a,"Driving to work in high school, this song would always play on the radio./It's an upbeat song that makes me happy./I like that it sounds like a song to can have fun singing along to at a party./Not really. I heard this song a lot on the radio in high school and it just made me happy, but I don't really have a special connection to it."
389,b,"The Weezer concert I went to recently./Weezer is one of my favorite bands and this is one of their biggest songs./It's easy to bob your hear to and it's lyrics are entertaining./Yes, this is the first Weezer song I every knew. My dad really enjoyed this song and I listened to it often with him when I was younger."
390,a,"It is from a video game, and I think of where it plays in the video game; it is a boss battle theme./I like to listen to it and other music form the game it is from./I like the music; in particular, the themes and melodies are great in this one./Not really. I have always liked it."
390,b,"I think about the soft, breathy timbre of the instruments./It is part of a video game soundtrack I really like./I like the music; in particular, I like the ambience of this piece./I don't have much of a relationship with it. I don't listen to this particular track as much as the others on this soundtrack."
391,a,"My wedding, because this song was played just before the wedding ceremony./Because I like listening to it. /I like the song musically and I like the memory about my wedding that it brings to me. /Yes. See above."

My relationship is slightly mixed since I like the music but I did not like the boss at all."
392,a,Jewish wedding/I love its joyfulness/Love the clarinet and the rhythms/No
392,b,Nostalgia/I love the simplicity/Reminds me of earlier time in my life and surviving it/No - only memories
393,a,"Nostalgia; it reminds me of university when my best friend and I used to listen to it together /I really like the soundtrack /I like it, I like the music/Yes, it reminds me of being at university "
393,b,It makes me feel quite mellow /It's part of a soundtrack I like/It's quite mellow and I enjoy the sadness of the music /No
394,a,"It's nostalgic specifically in that its genre functions by recreating schema of bands that my friends and I can consider to be reminiscent of a sad 90s alternative./I've used it in a playlist and like this whole album./I kind of explained this in the first answer, but the song captures a nostalgic approach to angsty music in a way that's satisfying in its reminiscence of and homage to earlier music I have enjoyed before./Yes, it's one of my favorites on this album, and I think the only one I've used on a playlist."
394,b,Classic song/I remember wanting to listen to more full albums by Bowie and thought saving Hunky Dory would be good since its one of his earlier ones and I already liked a few of the songs./It's perfectly constructed melodically and has anticipation and excitement throughout. /Yes - I love listening to both this version and its Portuguese cover. It's also rather difficult to play on guitar relative to most that also just have one chord per measure.
395,a,"Premature birth of my daughter/It had huge relevance to my situation at the time. After she came out of hospital it took me a long time to be able to listen to the song without crying./I now enjoy telling my daughter (almost 9) her birth story and how the song was so relevant at the time./Yes, we were living in South Africa at the time (Parlotones are a SA band) and this was a popular song at the time.  I went to see them live when I was 7 months pregnant and knew there were complications with the pregnancy that may result in an early birth.  We were very fortunate that there were no medical complications, but the who;e experience was really difficult to process, the song helps me realise just how lucky we were."
395,b,"Being a teenager.  This was the theme tune for Tour of Duty as US series about a platoon in the Vietnam War, my Dad was a drummer in his youth and when I started humming the tune randomly one day, he started tapping out the beat. A bizarre, happy connection over such a sad song. It started a real love of the Stones. /The start of my love affair with The Rolling Stones/Musically and lyrically it is very powerful, it's nostalgic and reminds me of becoming a teenager./It created a connection with my Dad as he didn't expect me to know the song."
396,a,"The movie it's from (""Your Name"")./I enjoy listening to it in transit.  /I enjoy listening to this track because it puts me in a good mood and relaxes me.  I enjoy the sound of the Japanese lyrics even though I don't understand them.  I also enjoy that the song is quite long--it's the kind of song I can almost forget I'm listening to, which is nice in transit. /Yes, my relationship with this track started when I heard it in the movie ""Your Name"" about six months ago.  I listened to the entire soundtrack a lot on Spotify but I bought this song on iTunes because I was making a mix CD for my sister-in-law for Christmas and thought she might enjoy hearing a Japanese pop song.  I associate the song with feeling content because it puts me back into the mind-set of being in Japan (I travelled there a few years ago).  "
396,b,My brother./I saved this track on my device to be able to play it in the car with my brother./I don't like this song.  It's on an album that I bought for my brother.  I skip it every time it comes up if he's not present.  /My relationship with this song is via my brother.  I don't have a relationship with it outside of that (other than it occasionally coming up on my phone and skipping to the next track).  
397,a,"The music video which features a black astronaut trapped in the future/I liked the video so much that I wanted to be able to relive the experience of watching it using the audio any time I want/It's very phonically complex, lots of texture which emerges from a very distinctive and simple introduction/No. I think relationships need to be bidirectional, and the track has no way of knowing I exist."
397,b,"Running through Cricklewood. I used to listen to it a lot when I was running more./I was listening to the album a lot and I wanted to be able to listen to it while running./It's a very good rhythm, and it's nicely associated with the euphoria of running./No. I'm not sure what you mean by relationship."
398,a,"Classic 80's hard rock/Like to have classic songs/albums on my iPod I have enjoyed over the years./One of the band's better songs,/Yes - good tune that puts you in a good mood (despite the lyric!)"
398,b,"OTT pomp!/Like the artist Robbie Valentine - very OTT, Queen like music./It is full of melody and pomp./Yes - I love pomp/OTT in music at times and along with Queen, Valentine does that"
