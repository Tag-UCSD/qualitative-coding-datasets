(wedding I believe) I often learn songs using spotify and it has remained in my playlist ever since.

-Melody serves as a very effective hook- it's receptive and supported by simple triadic harmony. 

-Interesting rhythmic feel; the verse primarily features only percussion style drums rather than a formulaic drum kit pattern. In contrast, the drum kit chorus groove is minimalistic and slightly unusual, featuring only bass drum on the downbeat and hit on the off-beat. This gives a very light bouncy, quite joyful feel in the chorus.

233,b,The message of this song which has helped me become more comfortable with my sexuality.\Because its a great song and a song that I can help pick me up at times when I'm feeling down especially if its due to someone's homophobia or if I'm worrying about what others might think of my sexuality.\Its an upbeat encouraging song aimed at gay people but the lyrics aren't too specific so some people could relate to it for other reasons. I really like its lyrics and too and Joey does have a good voice.\I first listened to this track when I was on the bus back home from town after someone had been homophobic towards me. I wanted to listen to some music to cheer me up and had heard about this song so I decided to give it a listen. I really enjoyed listening to it and its lyrics and music video made me feel better and the song has helped me to feel more comfortable about my sexuality and it has helped me feel more confident about being open about who I am. I selected 'enjoy' rather than 'really enjoy' because this song may mean a lot to me but I feel its not as strong as it could have been. I feel like the production and pacing could be better in places and the bridge and I feel like more could have been done with the bridge and final chorus. Its not a song I go back to that often but I still really like this song and appreciate how it has helped me.

306,a,"It has been a very long time since I listened to this song. There was a time when I used to think Jeff Buckley was brilliant, but these days I don't feel very connected to his music.

I used to be very much in that mindset, but growing older has rearranged my emotional priorities.  To be clear I want to point out that I do not use a listening device, I listen to all my music on youtube and do not make playlists. In order to get random song selection I scrolled down in my youtube suggestion list to the first song suggestion that I actually have listened to before. To my surprise, this came up. So I did not save it to my device, however I did do so many years ago when I first heard it. The reason back then was basically for research purposes (ie learning the parts), as I play guitar myself and thought it was brilliantly sung and played.


 I have mixed feelings with it, there's defenitely a sense of beauty in the performance and delivery, but at the same time the emotional delivery seem less relevant in my life today.

306,b,"How do these songs end up in my suggested list! I haven't listened to it for so long, yet somehow youtube knows this is my music. I listened to Bob Dylan when I was quite young, finding the records in my dad's record collection, and got myself familiar on the guitar playing many of his songs. I have also listened to Johnny Cash a lot and like his delivery very much. The type of vibe that this performance gives off is one that comes very easy for me to create with my own music, although I do prefer a more european sound. I do like this song a lot;  the original recording of it by Bob Dylan has one of my all time favorite picking patterns. This particular performance is nice because Bob Dylan starts off singing his verse in his (at that time) regular style, after which Cash gives a very heartfelt rendition of his verse, changing the mood. Upon experiencing the delivery by Cash, Dylan subsequently adapts his delivery of the next verse to a similar passionate style. Again, not recently saved, but saved when I first heard it. I like this song and like the cooperation of the two musicians whom I both like.  Let's be honest, it is kind of a boring song if your not in the mood for it. But it is one that has become part of my history. I must say I was expecting to find songs that I have been listening to more recently and that I feel more emotionally connected to at this very moment, which would have perhaps made for more interesting writing, but song selection was definitely random and unexpected. The original recording of this song has one of my favorite picking patterns. As far as playing this myself, of all of Dylan's songs (of which I learned, and forgotten, many) this is in the top few songs that have stayed with me and I still enjoy playing. So it must appeal to me in a special way. Although I have never given this any thought conciously, I must say the theme of distant love is definitely one that I know myself to be drawn to.","I have also listened to Johnny Cash a lot and like his delivery very much. / As far as playing this myself, of all of Dylan's songs (of which I learned, and forgotten, many) this is in the top few songs that have stayed with me and I still enjoy playing So it must appeal to me in a special way.

313,a,"I love the energy and rhythmicity of it. As soon as it started, I was bouncing around in my chair! I've seen the band play live, and when they perform this piece the percussionist sits at the front of the stage, and strikes a variety of objects extremely rapidly all the way through the piece, to a very tight and well-defined rhythm. I can visualise the physical effort and control he displays, and that feeds into my experience of the piece. But it's also generally a very lively and joyful piece -- I smile when I hear it -- so I don't feel the percussionist's physical effort as a strain, as such: more like extremely energetic dancing. I bought the CD at a gig by the Graham Fitkin band. I wanted to have the music to listen to, because I enjoy the pieces per se -- but it also lets me carry a bit of the memory of the gig around with me. As I mentioned above: energy, rhythmicity, joyfulness, memories of great nights spent watching the band. I feel I have a very physical relationship with this track, because of the driving energy of the rhythms and my memories of the percussionist playing.
