NOTES\
- Looking at one-liner changes is nearly not needed. There is not many things that can go wrong in one line of code and the automated tools would have caught most of the issues already.\
- One-liners are mostly very obvious in what is going on. There could be a connection to an adjacent logic though.\
- Has different levels of attention in different types of projects. These depend on the criticality of the project.}
