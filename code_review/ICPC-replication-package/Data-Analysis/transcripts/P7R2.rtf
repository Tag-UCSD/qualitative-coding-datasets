\f0\fs28 \cf0 REVIEW TYPE AND GOAL\
- Added themself to have a more interesting review that most of their review queue and the are familiar with the component that is being updated with another reusable component which they are also familiar with.\
- They want to add a new component in the extension menu in the browser\
\
TRANSCRIPT\
- Reads the title\
- Opens the extension list in the browser to demonstrate what is the area that is going to be touched.\
- Follows the bug ID link in the title of the PR to go to the issue tracker.\
- After reading the issue which also contains other links and a screenshot of the original state, concludes that they are updrading an older component displaying warnings which they are retiring in the extension list to a newer one which is the new way to display warnings within the browser. It looks better.\
- In the history of the issue there is not much happening - there is some wiring of some other bugs like removing all the code associated with the old component.\
- Another bug that was related to the old message bar is being disregarded as they do not have to worry about it anymore.\
- And another which provides more accessibility etc to this new component.\
- All the bug descriptions they read by hovering over the bug number.\
- The reviewer doesn\'92t consider these as per important to the review itself.\
- Goes back to the patch in Phabricator\
- The original version of the patch came around 1 month ago so it is going back and forth there for about a month which is interesting.\
- Scrolls to the discussion. Finds the comment from the author showing the before and after of the component. The spacing is better, the icon is aligned correctly.\
- The reviewer thinks the old version was a bit misuse of the message bar component as it was not meant to be in such constrained space so the icon was awkwardly aligned in the centre to account for the big block of text.\
- The newer component is better suited, it makes more sense and is better suited and more consistent with what they have in other places.\
- Another reviewer suggested the component can be cleaned up including a screenshot. However, the reviewer cannot see what is the difference. Clicks on an included link which opens a new tab with highlighted code. Realizes it removes some margins around the component.\
- It makes sense to do it as they do not want to change the styling of the message bar internally.\
- Then, there is a question if there is an issue with another change that has not been pushed yet. The reviewer just reads but does not further react.\
- There is a rebate push after those changes and a screenshot of how the message bar looks now. That\'92s great. The link to learn more is more in line with the text, spacing looks OK.\
- Next comment is from [name] who is their theme reviewer and they seem happy with it which is always a good sign if another reviewer is happy.\
- Then there is another reviewer of their UI who has some questions about accessibility but the rest is good.\
- in another comment - [name] is a localisation reviewer and the author was touching some strings. The [name] issue signing off on the string changes.\
- Then, the author is replying to the questions about accessibility and how they were addressed.\
- Then one of the reviewers replies with a clarification of how the strings have to be treated in the system to be able to provide their translation.\
- Whenever there are changes to strings and their IDs they like to do it with a script so that the volunter contributors do not need to translate strings that were already translated but in the case that the content of the string is changed it must be retranslated. That its what the reviewer is taking from the discussion but also has some knowledge about the ease for volunteers.\
- The next comment is from their accessibility expert. It seems to the reviewer that the expert came in to ensure that the new version of the component is ready to be used with a screen reader.\
- It seems from the discussion that there is a lot of concern about the link with Learn more and if it is introduced correctly for the screen readers.\
- That includes several comments from other reviewers and the author.\
- Sees that the original filer of the bug and a person from the team working on reusable components Is saying in was well was they have deep understanding of the goal and also the accessibility in the context.\
- The accessibility expert comes in again to say \'93r+\'85\'94 on the change otherwise.\
- There are some ancient idioms (like the \'93r+\'94) in the language used in the company and project during code reviews and it\'92s related to a standard they use for writing commit messages. At the end of the commit message, they write r= and te a list of people who reviewed the patch. \'93R+\'94 means that the review can be added to that list. \'93R-\'93 means that you request some changes and r+ means that you reviewed and approve. At this point it is just anachronism and it is not really reflected in their tooling in any way. They just still tend to say it though.\
- There are some failing tests that need to be adjusted.\
- Someone has fixed the tests.\
- Then the filer of the bug is happy as well and accepts the revision.\
- Then, there is a comment from a new reviewer from the team of reusable components.\
- The reviewer thinks that this patch is receiving so much feedback and scrutiny from few reasons but mainly because it is written by an intern and the person I there to learn a lot and is asking feedback from many people.\
- The reviewer knows all the other reviewers and their roles because they are on the same team as some of them. At some point the worked with all of them. They did not interact before with the author. One of the accesssibility team members has reviewed the reviewers patch before. So the reviewer is at least familiar with who they are and what are their specialities, what are the things they tend to review and the lens they are using to review and the series of speciallities they can review for. That\'92s also due to experience. The reviewer is working in the company for 13 years and had the opportunity to work on lots of different things with lots of different people. So while many of the people are not in their team directly on the org chart, they tend to move around to different areas of the code base and its a bit like a small town where they don\'92t live in the same house but they recognise them because they live just down the street, they know them by name and know what they are doing.\
- And also the last reviewer has accepted the patch.\
- That is the end of the discussion.\
- So almost everyone excepted the patch. There is just one blocking thing missing.\
- Scrolls back up to see the list of the reviewers. The patch is still waiting for some theme reviewer to chip in. Scrolling through the discussion again - the theme reviewer who commented never gave their approval so the patch is waiting fro someone from their team to sign off.\
- The reviewer got to the review from their email as they monitor changes that seem interesting. They have some expertise as they worked on the extension panel when it was first implemented and they also use that reusable component that is being implemented there.\
- So now the reviewer can have a look at what the author did.\
- Now sees the first file and wonders where exactly they are (the changes on line 1379). SO the change is in the event handler when the panel first shows up. SO they first check whether they should show a notification or message. Fastly examines the diff and then says \'93I see\'94 - They used to make it lazily and then probably kept it around. Then sees on the left diff that actually no as it was removed later (white part of the hunk context). [examines] So we would remove it but keep a reference to it. [Thinks a bit]. Thinks that what is happening is that when the panel first showed up and they needed to show the notification they had a variable which if it was null they created a new message id and set it up a little bit, then append it to the container and show it. Then if the state was changed and the notification is not needed anymore, they remove the element from the container but keep a reference to it. So next time if they need to show it they don\'92t need to do the setup just attach it again to the container and show. SO th author is now changing what the function that abstract making the message bar is doing and passes a different argument - reads what is in there and lets it be for the moment.\
- Scrolls a bit down and says that the new hunk is probably the meat of the change.\
- But, before actually going into it the reviewer wants to see what everything is actually changing. Wants to scroll around a bit. There are some test changes, some strings - a lot of conversation and review comments about the strings, some css and then the script that migrates the strings so that the translators do not need to do that.\
- Concludes that the real meat of the change is in the current method making the message bar - therefore, most of their time and energy and effort will be spent on that part.\
- Looks at the method again - the author is changing the argument accepted in the method.\
- First goes to see the left diff to know what the argument was meant to be used for. They created an element, set the attribute and append it. Which would allow to make the message they were adding - that some extensions are not allowed. It looks like the new message bar has that built in so the author does not need anymore the old setup and needs just the ID of the message bar.\
- Then the author uses a function to ensure custom elements, but the reviewer is not sure what it does and needs to remind themselves. So they hover over the method name. A dialog appears that allows to search for the method - that opens a new window of their tool to navigate the codebase. It allows to quickly search the source code as it is a snapshot of the source code in the browser and allows to quickly see what the method does.\
- Sees a function above that is being used by the one that is currently used.\
- Goes back to Phabricator\
- The current function returns a promise so there is no guarantee that that process is completed and then they still do some further actions even though the bar might still not be created.\
- Adds a comment to the method ensuring custom elements saying they are not sure if it matters there but that the used function returns a promise - goes back to the search tool in the other tab and uses a button to add a permalink to the line of code they are referring to - so after the line is executed there is a possibility if the element was not yet loaded. Also says they are not sure if it is a problem but wanted everybody to know about it.\
- It seems that even if it is not fully loaded it will attach itself\'85 but they are not entirely sure\'85 then edits the comment that in the worst case the bar is not imported yet and when the next line is executed it doesn\'92t get bound to the desired component because the component definition gets loaded after the message bar is added to the DOM. Elaborates further on their reasoning.\
- Identified this as an issue as they were not sure what the method did and they looked it up and as soon as they saw it returns only a promise it became clear they were using a dangling promise and usually you would wait to receive the promise and halt other tasks to sync what needs to be synced. In this case they do not work with the return value at all and just continue doing what they were doing so they run the risk that they will bee executing things out of the expected order.\
- It is possible that the author thought that is a synchronous action.\
- It is a little unusual the usage of that and the reviewer is not sure if it will create a problem. And in the past, the reviewer was burnt by issues like this.\
- It could also happen that the tests already have that bar loaded as a sideffect but it is possible that somebody has done changes that affect whether the module is loaded which would mean that they break the thing over here without even realising because there is an implied assumption that either the module is loaded and then they call it the next time they are using that code and they are hoping that everything is bound correctly to the components. The second assumption is that even when the element is not loaded it will attach to the pre-existing DOM. If the second thing is true, there is a potential problem and it is non-obvious. SO the reviewer is calling it out because they think it should be made clear for the people in the review or for future bug archeologists that will find a bug and will need to figure out what happened and they can see the comment and know they at least talked about it and this was their rationale.\
- Continues walking through the actions in the code. The rest looks pretty standard.\
- Then there is a piece of left diff removed that the author doesn\'92t need anymore. Some of the things were moved up in the previous lines the reviewer checked.\
- It looks like before they needed to manually set some things that could be attached to the element, but now the element internally already handles them, like having a title and a message. SO now there is no need for it anymore.\
- There are some previous comments. The reviewer does not care about them anymore. There is a signifier on the comment it is related to previous revision, the contrast of the comment is lower and it is marked as Done. So the reviewer is not really paying attention but because they read all the comments before, they are familiar with what it was about.\
- The point of reading all the comments is mostly not to make comments that are in contradiction with a decision that has been made which happened before. That a new person or an intern asks a feedback from many people and someone gives them a direction and then another reviewer gives a completely opposite direction and feedback and then the intern is confused about which direction to choose. At least the reviewer wants to be consistent for the intern not to confuse them and frustrate them and to ensure they get the bests possible solution.\
- In case they would not agree with some solution that other reviewer has said the reviewer might communicate with the reviewer privately to understand whether or not they  agree with the issues that the reviewer might have with the proposed direction and then the two of them could together redirect the intern. They always should have that united front so that the intern does not feel like reviewers are arguing over their patch. That is not helpful. It does not allow the interns to be confident that the reviewers know what they are doing. They all want to have a shared coherent story of how they want the patch to proceed.\
- If there is a technical argument between more seasoned developers/engineerss on how to best proceed with something,\'85 They got much better over the years in how to make the discussion civil. 10 15 years ago it used to be much more brusk but people have learned how to be polite in reviews. Specially because the tooling is much better they learned to be more polite and conscientious in the reviews and welcoming. Something that they always need to have on their mind and make sure is that whether the contributor is a seasoned engineer, a newcomer or a volunteer from the community, they have to acknowledge the patch and the effort that went into the patch. We do not need to agree with their approach but it does not mean that we have to be jerks about it. We have to direct them gently. There is an art to it and finessing and rhetorical art to not threaten a person. We obviously do not threaten people but to make are that the person does not feel intelectually threatened by the reviewer. To make sure that in the review do not come out as attacking the reviewer because you don\'92t agree with how they did a thing. You want to gently approach the disagreement and say: I think I know what you are doing here, I understand why you are doing it - did we consider X or Y? Phrase it more as questions than imperatives. Say not \'93we must do this, we must do that\'94 but \'93did we consider this, did you factor that\'94 because it\'92s possible that the reviewer is also wrong. Maybe there is some pre-existing information that the author has that the reviewer doesn\'92t have and they might be wrong. The reviewer thinks there is an art of humility on both - being a reviewer and a reviewee. And we all work on that ourselves.\
- Comes back to reviewing the code.\
- Sees the same pattern as before where the author changes some arguments using the ensre custom element promise.\
- Adds a comment that refers to its similarity to the above scenario and explains again the issue in this context.\
- The reviewer says anyone using these reusable components could chip in.\
- Goes to the code base navigation tab to check who wrote the ensure custom element method and realises the person who last changed it is one of the reviewers.\
- Through using the tooltip on hover can access older adjustments to the code. So the reviewer is jumping to the past to figure out who wrote the function originally. Did not find a conclusive name but thinks it was [name]. Tags them in the comment and asks that the reviewer thinks [name] wrote the function originally and if there is anything to be concerned about.\
- Then continues to review the code - similarly, the url element they \'93set some attributes on it and then move on\'85\'94\
- The whole main change makes sense to the reviewer.\
- Then the url is added to the message and added to the DOM as the reviewer saw above before.\
- The tests needed some adjustment as well. It\'92s a utility which makes some assertions and the author checks whether a string label matches expectations. Somehow another argument was deleted altogether. Given that the accessibility people already approved the change, the reviewer is not going to question that. The reviewer trusts that they know what they are doing. It sounds fine as an idea.\
- The labels were pointing to element IDs but it is not possible to do inside a reusable component so they need to assign an actual string so that the screen readers can take it. \
- They are also changing the selectors in the message bar. It is nice that it could be done only in one place. Makes sense.\
- Then reviews the actual strings that go into the message about not allowed extensions. The reviewer likes to pay a lot of attention there as strings are where typos tend to slip in. People often think about it as leftovers and then to pay more attention to the logic and business logic and technical details, they tend to forget but the strings definitely affect the user.\
- Reads all the strings. They look good to them. There is a lot of discussion attached to the strings. The reviewer skims it and says everyone kind of agreed. Then there is some conversation on the migration and the reviewer from the reusable components is happy with it.\
- Then the old style is removed. It\'92s not needed anymore. The author only got rid of one of the styles but the filer of the bug mentioned that there are 2 other styles that could be gone.\
- Goes to the beginning of the history, scrolls down to look at the comments and finds a comment from the filer of the bug that maybe only one of them can be cleaned. SO that makes sense as the other styles are still doing useful stuff - dealing with margins etc. that need to be consistent. While the removed part dealt with something internal of the component and it makes sense to get rid of it. The reviewer is happy about that.\
- Then there is the migration part which was already reviewed by 2 localisation reviewers so this reviewer is happy to ignore that part as they are more expert on that thing.\
- The reviewer was not assigned to this patch but did a drive-by so they are not going to give a verdict as they came into a patch of somebody else without an invite. They will just add comments.\
- Writes a review message saying that the author did not request a review but they saw the patch fly by and had some questions about the ensure elements. Maybe those are not for the intern author, but for the group to better understand when to use the custom elements.\
\
GENERAL STRATEGY\
- Reading discussion, Top to bottom, splitting the review into topic areas using the search code base tool when understanding is needed\
\
INTERVIEW\
I: So both of the reviews you just added yourself - that's something you commonly do, something that's expected of you?\
\
P7:  So in a way, I did it because I knew this exercise was coming. I was more compelled to try and select - I wanted to make sure that you got to see someone review something meaty. So would I normally go hunting for reviews to do? No, not necessarily. But that very first one. I probably would have added myself, because I saw it go. I get a lot of emails, and one of the things that Phabricator does is whenever certain files are touched it will alert certain people. And in the case of the migration tool component, because I'm one of the owners, and because I think I've set up some rules so that I'm alerted to changes to it. I saw it go by, and so I think I would have done that. I would have\
added myself as a reviewer, mainly because the author was changing how the migration tool itself works. Now the migration tool change that she made internally is perfectly acceptable. All she's doing is exporting a member like she's making something more easily stylable with css. She exported a part and the rest of my critique was about whether or not the solution actually solved the problem fully - like whether or not we care about really short screens. Or maybe it's fine. I don't know, but I wanted to make sure we had that discussion and so that we have it on the record. But normally I will get review requests landing in my my queue maybe 2 or 3 every other day. And just this morning, whenever I looked in my queue I only saw like one thing, and so I wanted to make. And it wasn't very complicated. It was looking at the description. It was like, we're just gonna remove a bunch of tests. And I didn't want you to have to sit through that.\
\
I: I would be happy in a way. But I felt a difference between the two reviews. In the first one I felt you let's say, maybe responsible and confident, you know, for all the comments and the review that you were doing right. While in the second one you were more like - okay, there's many other people that are giving feedback that are responsible for that part. And now I just come in with some additional comments. How is it different for you the review when you are just stopping by or I am in some way responsible?\
\
P7: I think, for the migration tool. It helps that I helped like architect it. And I am deeply, deeply familiar with how it works and how it can be embedded. Like I'm probably the one who has the sharpest mental model of the whole system of how the migration tool works. There are a bunch of people who have worked on it, but because I architected it I am fairly confident in my understanding of the ecosystem. And so whenever I saw the author\'92s patch, which was also fairly short, it was like 2 things. I know it looked like 3, but one of those file changes but one of those changes was generated at build time. So the other 2 there were really just 2 changes. There was like, the author\'92s exporting a part. And they are adding a css rule. And those 2 things are very small.I wouldn't call any of that like sort of a logical change to behavior. If this, then that, then do this, then that like there's nothing like that got changed. Declarative changes occurred. Do you know what I mean?\
\
I: Yeah.\
\
P7: Okay, so in the in the second patch, it was a lot of imperative changes. You know the logic of how we construct things and then add that rule, and then do this and then do that. And so whenever that occurs I tend to like to execute those lines in my head like the machine would to just sort of like create a model of what would happen. I didn't test the second patch I probably would have if we had time. But I wanted to clearly understand what it was doing, and that's much easier to do with like a declarative patch where I can like, see? Oh, okay, these rules have changed, the authohr\'92s adding a css. I think if it's a very big css change, or a very big change of like declarative rules, I might actually need to to see it. But like because it was very, very small and constrained. I was fairly confident, right off the bat that I knew exactly what she was doing, and I knew exactly how what the impact would be with the second patch. I needed to execute it, to understand what exactly was happening, and so I needed to go through it line by line.\
\
I:  Is it then more difficult for you to review?\
\
P7: Certainly I think the second one requires a little bit more muscle because I needed to go outside of my domain of expertise a little bit more. I wasn't familiar with that ensure custom elements part and I have a lot a lot less confidence in what I said in my review. In those 2 comments, I'm not entirely certain how ensure custom elements will work. I I'm mainly just kind of showing up and going: Hey, gang, did we think about this problem like, is this a problem, or are we good here? Whereas in the first one, I think I'm fairly confident that if we care about short windows - like minimal vertical screen or very long lists then we still have a problem. But is it more difficult? I think it requires more muscle. Yeah.\
\
I: I also wanted to ask you - you comment quite early on in the second one or the final that there's a lot of comments, a lot of people involved. And that\'92s when you somehow arrived  at: Okay, so this is an intern. But is this something like that, if you see a lot of discussion, is it something that raises some needs to explain why all the discussion is there?\
\
P7: there could be a number of different reasons like an intern. So what's interesting about this patch is that it's touching a couple of different things. You've got the unified extensions panel - so you have to bring in the web extensions people because that's their area of the code base. But it's also the intern is working with the reusable components team. That's [name] and [name]. And so they're the ones who are kind of mentoring the author. And then you've got, you know, accessibility people and localization people kind of weighing in from their specialties, and that can occur even for seasoned developers depending on what it is that they're touching because there are these like isolated domains, like modules that you might touch, and you only need one reviewer. But there's also, like the the in-betweens, the sort of the the fabric in between modules, and that's where the author is touching. This is sort of membrane in between disjoint pieces, because it's a thing that's being embedded in something else, kind of like the migration tool. Both of these are actually perfect examples of this where you've got this joining of 2 things embedding one thing inside of another thing. And so you kind of need to have experts from both camps weigh in to make sure the thing is being used correctly, and that it's not going to disturb the surrounding environment that it's being embedded in. You know what I mean. I think the fact that the author is an intern meant that a lot of people would probably get involved, at least both of her mentors. It's also possible that if I touch ed the exact same part of the code that same set of people would also have weighed in as well. That's possible. And does it, you ask me, does it make it more difficult when there's a lot of conversation. No, if anything, it increases my confidence when there are a lot of people involved that we're all looking at it. We're all thinking about it from different perspectives. And we're all kind of bringing our experience to bear on it that we're gonna arrive at a solution that we all agree and understand with, like, we're all gonna go - Okay, we all get it. And that's helpful, for when\'85 suppose something goes wrong with that patch. Suppose a month down the line we realize there's a bug in it, and the author left, finished her internship, and she's gone to work at some other company or something. You've got this group of other people who are familiar with what happened in here. And that's actually really nice when you've got this like little community that formed around this patch as opposed to just one person. Like, whenever you have an author, and a reviewer, and something goes wrong with a patch you have 2 people that you can talk to to move forward with how do we repair any regressions or something? Or how do we deal with what occurred in here. Here we've got like a larger community, and that's kind of nice. So I don't know if I've exactly remember the thrust of your question, but whenever I see all of that conversation, and I actually feel like - Oh, good, you know, like, there's a lot of people looking at this. And so that always feels nice.\
\
I:  What you also said at some point, was that - Okay, I'm going to ignore this part because the responsible person already saw it. Is this something that you do sometimes? Like - Okay, I'm not getting about doing like full review, because I know that some part was already reviewed enough?\
\
P7: It depends. So in that particular case what we were talking about was the migration, the localization of strings. And that is like a very discrete sub-discipline when creating a patch like it's something that our localization team and our localization community cares deeply about. And it's kind of their problem domain. It's tooling that they've built. It's tooling that they maintain and understand, and they are the experts of it. I am not an expert of how our migrations work, and so I'm far less confident that anything that I would be able to find any problems with it or have any cogent suggestions on how it could be improved. Like I fully expect our localization engineers and developers to be like much, much more deeply familiar with how best to do a migration.\
\
I: Yeah. Another thing I wanted to ask is about the old version of the code. Because what what I see quite frequently is that people look at the new version of the code, and if that works it's fine, you know. But you went into, you know, really looking into how was the code before? How is it now? When is it a good thing to do? And when does it have a value? Why did you do it for yourself?\
\
P7: Sure. I guess it's because it's often harder to think about what was removed. Or\
in my experience that is the less obvious part - it's almost like what didn't I think about? So there are a couple of different levels. There's the changes that were made and the lines that were added, there are the lines that are removed, and then they're they're the lines that were never touched. That maybe should have been touched. And that's fully invisible is the stuff that wasn't touched that should have been touched or changed, and that's very difficult to identify this set. And so, by looking at both sets what was added and what was removed, or 3 added, removed and changed. I\'92m hoping that I can. I  try and suss out anything if there\'92s anything in this larger set of stuff that should have been changed. By looking at all 3  - removed, changed, added. If I just look at what was added and changed. I run the risk of missing some information. And I would hope that most reviewers are looking at also what was removed, because many times in my experience, things have been removed accidentally - functionality was disabled, or stuff was removed, and and it shouldn't have been. It was just purely accidental. Or maybe the author just misunderstood what some lines were doing, or they forgot they forgot to move something. And so it looked like a removal instead. So I think it's important to understand the full the full scope of the changes.}
