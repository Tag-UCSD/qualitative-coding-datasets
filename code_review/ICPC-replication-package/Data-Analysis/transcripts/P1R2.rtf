\f0\fs24 \cf0 REVIEW TYPE AND GOAL\
- Self-assigned review in a related repository\
- Wanted to update on what is happening\
\
CONTEXT\
- They noticed that a repository that their tests are heavily using is changing docs and wanted to check what is happening\
\
TRANSCRIPT\
- Check description and follow the link to the referred documentation.\
- Comes back to the review platform to review the code itself.\
- In the first file they find nothing they have questions about so they will not waste time on reviewing it further.\
- Reads comments of others to see whether they have the same questions.\
- Noticed comments that address her questions, so did not perform any further actions.\
- Writes a comment with a clarifying question to find a justification from the author on why the code is written in a certain way. They understand what is happening but keep a potential doubt that they are missing something and so they rather ask a question.\
\
\
GENERAL STRATEGY\
Always starts with docs references, then start reading the code.\
Top to bottom\
Code that does not make sense is cross-referenced with the provided documentation. If the documentation is not there, then she will ask to create or improve it.\
