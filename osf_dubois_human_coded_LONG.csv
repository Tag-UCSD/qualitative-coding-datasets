The protagonist goes deaf and, unable to hear the music that has sustained him, tries to recapture it with his pen. The novel was never published.

Washington to have been a man of remarkable skill in dealing with white America.

Du Bois sums up Brown’s views in his conclusion. “John Brown loved his neighbor as himself,” writes Du Bois. “He could not endure therefore to see his neighbor poor, unfortunate or oppressed.” Brown’s sympathy with the least advantaged was strengthened by his Christianity and influenced by the “social doctrines of the French Revolution with its emphasis on freedom and power in political life.” Added to all of this, Du Bois writes, was Brown’s own “inchoate but growing belief in a more just and a more equal distribution of property.” From this, Brown concluded that “all men are created free and equal.” It is this point that Du Bois wields against the eugenicists and white supremacists of his time, the intellectual descendants of slaveholders who dominated the mainstream of American letters with arguments about the natural inferiority of nonwhites. “Has John Brown no message — no legacy, then, to the twentieth century?” asks Du Bois. “He has and it is this great word: the cost of liberty is less than the price of repression. The price of repressing the world’s darker races is shown in a moral retrogression and an economic waste unparalleled since the age of the African-slave trade.” (I quoted a version of this line in my column on Tuesday.) Viewed in this light, Du Bois says, the memory of John Brown stands as a “mighty warning” to the United States and its peers. To wait to rectify the sins of the present — to sidestep justice in favor of comfort — is to make the final price of liberty all the more expensive. John Brown “knew that in 1700 it would have cost something to overthrow slavery and establish liberty; and that by reason of cowardice and blindness the cost in 1800 was vastly larger but still not unpayable,” Du Bois writes. “He felt that by 1900 no human hand could pluck the vampire from the body of the land without doing the nation to death.” What Brown decided, Du Bois continues, was that he had to strike a blow for justice in his time. “It will cost something — even blood and suffering — but it will not cost as much as waiting.” Du Bois was very much a man of his time — Victorian, bourgeois and more than a little elitist. You can see these aspects of Du Bois in his Brown biography, and for a modern reader, they may be a little jarring. And yet, Du Bois’s broadside against hierarchy and exclusion still lands with as much force in 2022 as I’m sure it did in 1909. His warning that the tolerance of injustice will only lead to darker places and “darker deeds” is still relevant.
