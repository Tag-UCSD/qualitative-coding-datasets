39,a,The intro is very haunting so I picture a dark club with red lights that flicker through the club..  I love BeyoncÃ©.. her music makes me feel like anything is possible.. makes me fee more positive and stronger about myself. The song is about a girl who works her hardest and pushes her self to numerous limits so she can get the best out of life but it's never enough.. So somehow it's pushing me to go finish my degree and work my hardest to get the life I want.. however it is sang in quite a sexual manner so people's views about the song may differ.. Not sure.. It's simply a powerful song,Positive, I love BeyoncÃ©.. her music makes me feel like anything is possible.. makes me fee more positive and stronger about myself.

I like to listen to playlists with songs that have similar tones and beats. This is a nice and relaxing song. It's also an interpretation of a classical tune which sounds cool in a jazz rendition. It's still mid Sunday morning when i'm doing this survey and it's come up as an appropriate track for this time of the day. It has enough variation to lift my mood but still has a calming effect. It gives me a familiar feeling. Maybe because i've known the tune for a long time and it really suits jazzy tones. It reminds me of my youth when i used to follow live jazz music around town.,Match Mood, It's still mid Sunday morning when i'm doing this survey and it's come up as an appropriate track for this time of the day.

(wedding I believe) I often learn songs using spotify and it has remained in my playlist ever since. It's really touching song. -Strong reverbs, percussion, and acoustic instruments produce a very calming quality about the song. 

-Melody serves as a very effective hook- it's receptive and supported by simple triadic harmony. 

-Interesting rhythmic feel; the verse primarily features only percussion style drums rather than a formulaic drum kit pattern. In contrast, the drum kit chorus groove is minimalistic and slightly unusual, featuring only bass drum on the downbeat and hit on the off-beat. This gives a very light bouncy, quite joyful feel in the chorus.
